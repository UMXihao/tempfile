Review #0:We booked a three-night stay at the Marquesa last week after we had to check out of our original hotel unexpectedly. I read the wonderful reviews on TripAdvisor and was able to get a room in the main house for a very reasonable price. From the moment we stepped inside the heavenly air-conditioning of the lobby, our expectations in all areas were surpassed. Caroline at the front desk was friendly and welcoming, and gave us a free glass of wine after we checked in. Our room on the third floor was sparkling clean, cool, and well-appointed, with window seats under the gables and a view out over Fleming St. The room was kept clean and neat and the turndown service each night was great. Everyone at the front desk was incredibly friendly and helpful throughout our stay. One of the best things about the Marquesa is the beautiful hidden courtyard with two pools. The garden is beautifully landscaped and there are towels, lounge chairs, and free water and iced tea (and, in the morning, coffee) for guests. We spent one long afternoon lounging there and it was wonderfully relaxing! Overall, I canâ€™t think of a single thing I would change about our stay. The Marquesa was a lucky find for us, and weâ€™ll absolutely recommend it to everyone! Review #1:We visit Key West often but have been staying at different places. We have now settled in to our favorite! Close to Duval but peaceful and secluded when you want it. The service was great, clean rooms,beautiful gardens and pool, helpful staff, and great bed. Walk every place in old town made easy. Take my word and enjoy the Conch Republic in style. Review #2:Management is very helpful with suggestions of things to do, where to dine, and directing their guests around Key West. The Marquesa Cafe offers great evening diining. Continental breakfast, an additional fee, is served in the guests rooms - or weather permitting - on the guests patios. The central courtyard is very private, sheltered, and quiet. Water, iced tea, and towels are set out daily for guests to enjoy while in the courtyard enjoying sun, shade, or swimming in one of two pools. One pool is heated and one not. The hotel sits back from Duval St by a couple of blocks in a quiet, historic, residential area. A true gem. Review #3:We loved the location of the Marquesa. We did not have to drive our entire stay. Walked everywhere. CLEANIEST hotel I've ever been in. We stayed in a junior suite, which gave us our own porch. We thoroughly enjoyed that. Bathroom was nice big size too. The grounds are beautiful and never seemed crowded. Loved the homemade blueberry banana bread for breakfast. Very happy there was parking onsite. Bed was comfortable. Staff was outstanding. Can't think of anything to complain about....oh just noise a couple of mornings when trash truck made pick up woke us up, but we went back to sleep after. Review #4:We LOVE this place! We found the Marquesa on our fourth trip to Key West and now it's the only place we stay when we go back. We eloped and married on the beach there several years ago, so KW has a very special place in our hearts. To us the Marquesa is quintessential Key West. The location is perfectly situated to all the bars, restaurants and activities you could want or need. Park the car once you arrive (for free) and never move it again until you leave. You're half a block from a great little grocery store and 2 short blocks from Duval. The restaurant on site is fantastic and the bar is very cozy. The service at the hotel is perfect - catering yet unobtrusive. Free wine at check in certainly helps you settle in too. Newspaper of choice is available every morning. The Chinese takeout across the street is among the best I've ever had. The pools at the hotel are incredible - private in a gorgeous setting with all the ice cold tea and water you can hold. The rooms are very finely appointed and the bathrooms fairly spacious with high end touches. Consistently awesome! Review #5:My wife and I just returned from our first trip to Key West. I had no idea where to stay but did know that I wanted to be close to the excitement of Duval Street, but not disturbed by it when I returned to my hotel. The Marquesa was the perfect choice; and aside from a great location, this hotel has character, and a fantastic staff, all for reasonable prices. Sounds too good to be true, but that is exactly what we experienced at this hotel. The pool area is beautiful, the rooms are clean, comfortable and spacious. To top it all, every morning there was fresh, good coffee waiting in the pool area. I can't say enough about how impressed we were with this hotel; we highly recommend it, and will stay there again next when we go back. Review #6:Every year we need a break before the New England winter settles in and always decide on Key West, but more specifically, the Marquesa Hotel. This is our seventh year staying at the Marquesa and each time it exceeds our expectations. We are always able to reserve the perfect Junior Suite overlooking the pool area - the reservations staff is so helpful in meeting our requests. The suites are very comfortable and well laid out and the balcony/patio area is the perfect place for breakfast or cocktails in the evening. Housekeeping service is exceptional - they even remember us from year to year! The entire staff is very helpful and welcoming. Special kudos to the "orchid lady" who grows such beautiful plants. Great location two blocks off Duval - quiet and peaceful but convenient to everything. The adjoining Cafe Marquesa has to be the best restaurant in Key West - wonderful food, changing menu (try the Small Plates), creative chef and again terrific staff. Review #7:This was my second trip to Marquesa--i gave it good reviews last year. This was my first time visiting during the peak season. The rate was 450 plus tax for a Jr. Suite. It was great room and amenities are good. They now have flat screen TVs. Internet service is free but spotty in rooms, excellent by the pool. There was a wine reception on Sat evening for the guests--a nice touch. Guests are different when its the high season. It's an older crowd and less diverse. It was spring break and quite a few teens were there with parents. I must say I was initially concerned, but they were all excellent guests and well behaved. A number of guests got complimentary upgrades to suites while I was there. While this is usual hotel practice, in a small property, I wish the staff was more discrete about it. I had fronted the money up front and received no special upgrade other than a check in bottle of Fiji water. The only other thing that bothered me was the snootiness of the front office staff. This is key west, land of the casual--attitude belongs on the mainland. When we checked out, we stayed a few hours in the lobby of the hotel until our flight. The owner came out of the office and asked if we needed help. We told hime we just checked out and were waiting to go to the airport. He shrugged his shoulders and left irritated we were sitting there. Now mind you, we spend 6 nights there and 3000 dollars in his hotel. A thank you and "I hope you enjoyed your stay" would have been more appropriate, Not all staff slung attitude. Housekeeping and grounds personel were lovely and very helpful. Overall, this is an excellent hotel and i'd stay here again. Most of my concerns were minor--but at 500 a night I left with a slight sour taste in my mouth. Review #8:Perfect location not far from Duval. The grounds are beautiful with most of the rooms enjoying a porch and lovely view of the pools and lush foliage. Our room was elegant, clean and well appointed. The staff was very helpful. Parking is easy as the property has a garage for guest use. Loved it! Review #9:My husband and I just enjoyed a fantastic three-night stay at the Marquesa. When we arrived, we received a warm welcome and an upgrade to a gorgeous third-floor suite. The desk attendant served us complimentary wine to enjoy while he parked our car and booked a dinner reservation for us at 7Fish. The hotel was the perfect home base as we explored Key West on foot, enjoying local restaurants and shops. My husband loved cooling off in the Marquesa's pools after a day of kiteboarding at Smathers Beach. The all-day iced tea and water served poolside was a nice touch. Small details like this really made our stay special. We ate very well in Key West, but our favorite meal was at Cafe Marquesa. Everything we ate, from the homemade bread and hummus to the blackberry ice cream for dessert, was fabulous and fresh. Service was excellent - attentive, but not stifling. Overall, our stay was perfect! Review #10:We picked this hotel based on TA reviews. Upon arrival we were greeted by Richard and made to feel as if we were the only guests. Richard sat down with us to review the both the history of the property as well as the current ammenities. He then reviewed the highlights of Key West. Richard offered that the hotel would make any necessary arrangements for extracurricular activites, including transportation rentals, meals and/or leisure activities. Following our introduction he met us at the garage entry and directed where to park the car. After leading us to our room, he filled the ice bucket and returned with two complimentary glasses of wine. The landscaping is amazing. Everything from the swimming pools, one heated and one not, both by design, to the manicured grounds. The courtyard, onto which the rooms and main entry opens, are truly an oasis. The main house and surrounding buildings were stunning. No detail was overlooked for an immaculate fit and finish. Our first room, a standard room, was charming, intimate and relaxing. We loved Key West so much, that we decided to stay another night. Due to a lack of avilability our standard rooms, we were upgraded to a JUNIOR SUITE for the same price we paid for the standard room. This room was poolside and amazing. Attention to detail and superior customer service made for a memorable trip and we already know where we are staying next time. Review #11:I have stayed at the Marquesa 4 times now for both business and pleasure and enjoyed every visit. The staff are unbelievably helpful and always willing to make the guests feel special. I have been fortunate to have the rooms overlooking the pool three times and only one time did I request it. The grounds are kept up very nicely and the rooms are up to date with high tech amenities and always very clean. The hotel is located right in the middle of downtown and only one block from the main street of shops and bars - Duval Street. Not very many people know about this little diamond in the ruff unless someone has told them about it. I hesitated writing a review because I don't want many people to know about my little find.- Orlando, Florida Review #12:This hotel has been beautifully remodeled and a true oasis in the middle of a busy city. It is close to Duvall Street without being in the traffic and noise. An easy walk to restaurants, shops, and attractions. If you book one of the "standard rooms" which we did as it was the only room left, be sure to ask the reservation agent about the views from the windows. We were told our room faced the Gardens but were not told that the view out the window was of the roof of the restaurant next to the gardens and of the exhaust fan serving the restaurant. This was a huge disappointment to us. The room itself was fine but small, which we were expecting. My only suggestion to the hotel would be to have at least one staff member at a location that is accessible to the guests. The computers and business functions are in a room off the parlor with a door and glass window. Employees sit with their backs to the door. Review #13:The Marquesa is a beautiful hotel that is exquisitely decorated. The restaurant is fantastic as was the service. The courtyard and pool area were a total escape from the Duval Street madness. A negative is the lack of an elevator, so if that is a concern keep that in mind when booking rooms. Overall a positive experience. We would go back. Review #14:My husband and I just returned from a 6 day stay, along with friends, at the best hotel we've ever visited. This was our fourth winter getaway to the Marquesa and it is a consistent delight! We were welcomed with an offer of a glass of wine and our room had a beautiful fresh orchid to give us a sense of the tropics after our harsh snowy winter. Our second floor poolside room shared a deck with a similar room which was occupied by our friends. Each morning we enjoyed a wonderful breakfast brought to the deck in minutes from the time it was ordered. The hotel has two pools in a courtyard garden which is serene and quiet. Iced tea and ice water is always available as are plenty of towels and lounges. We always have dinner at the Cafe Marquesa on our final night in Key West, calling it the Grande Finale, and grand it was. The four of us had a fabulous meal from start to finish, and a thoughtful server. The best part of the Marquesa experience is the incredible staff. They make a point of getting to know their guests and their interests. No request is too big. The staff make our dinner reservations in advance every year, then provide us with a summary of our places and dates (and are happy to make last minute changes and provide recommendations). Carol, the managing partner, is always available for a chat, as are Bob, the manager, and staff Mary, Sean, and Dennis. This year it took us over two days of cancelled flights and rental cars to arrive in Key West, yet the moment we disembarked at the Marquesa, all of the stress just vanished. We felt as if we were home, but in a home that pampers its occupants with luxury and the best of the human spirit. We already have our booking made for next year. Review #15:We just returned from an incredible stay at the marquesa. We stayed in room 18, a beautiful suite with a patio overlooking the pool. We just love the feel of this hotel, you really feel like you are staying at a friend's house. The staff was very attentive but inconspicuous. I swear the housekeeping staff watched us leave because if we were gone, we came back to a full ice bucket and a tidy room. Can't wait to return next year! Review #16:My buddies and I went down to Key West for five days of drinking and shenanigans during the powerboat races. At the start of the trip there was like a 90% chance we were going to destroy the hotel room. As soon as we got there the staff was courteous, friendly, and extremely helpful even though most service people would have treated us poorly based on appearances. That changed our whole outlook and we were instead courteous, quiet, and clean. The staff is the best I have ever seen in a hotel. They had iced tea and coffee outside on a table by the beautiful pools. Every time we had a request for daytime activities, like jet skis and fishing, the concierge knew a guy who had a great deal for a good time. Plus, they were like janitorial ninjas, every time we went out we came back to a cleaned room and were never interrupted by housekeeping. How do they do that? It's close to Duval St with all of the associated bars and restaurants, and walking distance to anything of importance. (except the airport, meh) The only thing it could use was a microwave in the room, but the bigger suites probably have that. Review #17:Wanted to get a quiet getaway by myself in Key West for a couple of days. This was the place. Everything is pristine here and this is the best B&B in Key West. The restaurant food is excellent. The rooms are wonderful. I have stayed here before and have had the pleasure of staying in several different rooms throughout the property. All the rooms are beautifully decorated and spacious. The property has two pools of which one is heated. The lush landscaping makes your stay quite enjoyable when you return from walking on Duval street. Sitting by the pool in this little paradise really made all the stresses of life just go away. Review #18:Made a spur of the moment reservation at Marquese by phone and checked in the following day. On arrival we were greeted by Mary, who has a way about her, one of the most gracious people I have ever met. She showed us to our room, and returned a few minutes later with wine for us. Everything about this hotel is perfect. Extremely comfortable, very pretty, very relaxing, amazing staff. After having dinner at Marquesa's restaurant - also very good, the waiter offered to deliver dessert to our room since we were tired and stuffed, and he walked with us, carrying dessert back to our room. Marquesa is heaven. Review #19:We have just returned from 3 nights at the Marquesa. Very impressed with this hotel. The staff could not be any nicer! A nice touch is indoor parking, but it is small and limited to about 9-10 cars. We arrived about 3:30pm and got the last indoor spot. There is additional parking outside. We had a 'Queen Deluxe' room (#2). It had a comfy queen sized bed, and a fold out queen sized sofa bed that I was told was surprisingly comfortable by the folks who used it. I was expecting the room to be a little larger, but the 4 of us weren't too cramped. The bathroom was very large. Nice 26" (or so) LCD TV. Private deck overlooking one of the 2 pools with 2 chairs, 2 small tables and a lounger. The landscaping is awesome, lots of palms and tropical foilage. Well maintained, and very nice.The location is very nice. One minute, half block walk to a small but nicely equiped grocery, with a deli and beer/wine, liquor store just a minute further (on Fleming towards Duval). Mallory Square is just about a 10 minute walk... if you don't stop for a drink or shopping. The Cafe Marquesa adjacent, look very elegant, but too upscale for us so we did not eat there. I did look at a menu and entrees were in the $30-$40 neighborhood. We were there mid-week and there were always chairs and loungers available poolside, with fresh large towels provided and always available. The staff were very attentive and always available to help us in any way needed. The $50 per person, per night charge for the 3rd and 4th person was a bit excessive I think, but the same was being charged by other hotels I checked before booking. Overall, we really enjoyed the hotel and our stay and would easily recommend it to family and friends. Review #20:I stayed at Marquesa Hotel for five nights in June 2010 based on the recommendation of friends (who were also traveling with us). I can't say enough good things about this boutique hotel. The staff were very attentive - everything is spotless (even the pool-side restroom). I took advantage of the promotion they offered that provided an upgraded room. Therefore, I booked a stanrdard room but received a pool-side deluxe room. The size of the room was adequate. As I mentioned before, everything was spotless. Upon arriving, we were treated to a glass of wine by the pool. Hotel staff was happy to point out great places to dine and sites to see. One afternoon, we were treated to fresh watermellon by the pool in addition to the water and iced tea that was offered daily. The staff was very attentive without being intrusive. There are two pools w/ adequate chairs and umbrellas. The location of the hotel is ideal if you want to be a short walk to Duval Street but far enough away from the noise and crowds. I highly recommend this hotel to those who appreicate boutique hotels and have high expectations. Review #21:Main plus points - beautiful peaceful grounds (there seems to be music playing wherever you go now but none here-relief). Beautifully furnished rooms, great bathroom. Staff very discrete and left us alone. Good location. Free parking out of the sun. Very high level of cleanliness. Minus points - astonished that at this level of hotel there is no complimentary water. It was in the high 80s and 90s but no water to be had (unless you buy it from the mini-bar.) Some staff a bit cold. No room service menu. Some of the sun beds looking a bit shabby. Review #22:Booked three nights stay at the Marquesa based purely on Tripadvisor reviews - Upon arrival we could see that this was the correct decision.This hotel is immaculate in every respect and a little piece of paradise in the middle of Key West. Paid an on-line "offer " price of $250 per night for a suite and justified this amount due to it being our last three nights stay of a two week tour of Florida. If you fancy a treat stay here. There is a local supermarket within 100 yds if you need anything - they also have an excellent deli that makes tasty fresh sandwiches while you wait. Considered the Marquesa to be one of the best small hotels we've ever stayed in........That's a compliment. Review #23:From the moment we checked in, everything was perfect. We had a junior suite in newer building. Large and quiet with a mostly private lanai. Grounds are beautiful, employees very helpful, all details attended to. 2 pools. "Nothing to complain about " which is what we said when we checked out- can't always say that. Would stay there again without a doubt. A 5 star hotel. Review #24:I work in the hospitality business and the entire staff at the Marquesa achieved the highest level of customer service in the 2 days we stayed that we encourage our team to accomplish with each of our guest each and every day. Friendly, prompt, courteous, and extremely helpful- completely defines excellent customer service. I highly recommend and will return very soon. Review #25:While much of Key West is catering now to the cruise ship business and has become more and more honky-tonk, this lovely hotel retains the former charm and quaintness of Key West in an upscale fashion. The staff are all lovely; the grounds are beautiful; the rooms are sumptuous, and the hotel is centrally located. My partner and I had a great time there although the clientele is mainly straight. Our only complaints were that there were no premium cable stations which is odd for a place of this caliber, and that the unheated pool should be heated so there are more swimming options. Almost no one swam in the unheated pool. Otherwise, this is an exceptional small hotel. Review #26:With so many already positive reviews, I just have to ad that they go out of the way for special requests! This is a great model for anyone in the hospitality business. I have worked for the Disney Co, and they do a top job, I have seen pretty bad places to great places, and this is one of the ones I rate other by. Even I , and I am tough to please enjoy this property! Review #27:We paid around $290 for a corner room in the main building which faces the street. The room itself is quite nice and tastefully decorated with luxury soaps and shampoos in the bathroom. The hotel does not smell like a hotel. It feels more like staying in a very expensive house. We didn't use the pool itself but we went out in the evening and sat poolside. The pool area is beautiful and the landscaping is superb. The only negative with the room itself is noise from the street and doors opening/closing at certain times of day. It's not incredibly noisy because the location is off Duval but I expected less from this level of hotel. They should try to noiseproof the rooms overlooking the streets. As other reviewers noted, breakfast is not included which was dissappointing but there are good brunch places very close by. The location is ideal: two blocks off Duval in a safe area. After we parked, we never had to use the car for the weekend. Note that there are not enough parking spaces for all the rooms so you need a little luck getting a spot. The hotel service was good and the restaurant/tour recommendations were inline with the hotel class. In other words, they were good. We dined at the Cafe Marquesa one night. The food was very good except we had to wait 30 minutes for our table although we made reservations the previous day. However, they took care of us at dinner with a freebie and the service was outstanding. One other improvement is the internet access. They have wireless service but I had trouble connecting due to poor reception. Obviously, I didn't use it that much but you gotta have it. They seem to have a hotel computer you can use though. Overall, I would definitely recommend it even with the issues mentioned. We went at peak season so most decent places will charge $200+/per night. For a little extra, we got to stay at a very memorable hotel. Review #28:We had a wonderful stay at the Marquesa Hotel in May 2009. The hotel is situated two blocks off Duval (the main thoroughfare), which was a very convenient location for getting anywhere on the island. We stayed in a poolside standard room on the second level. The hotel was very quiet and felt very private, despite being located in the downtown. Our room was beautiful and extremely clean. The housekeeper came through twice a day to make sure it was well-appointed. Henry, a concierge, was so attentive to our needs and easy to work with. The pools at the Marquesa were fantastic! There are two (one heated, one not) located behind the hotel. They are surrounded by lush tropical gardens. Even though downtown Key West is just on the other side of the hotel, you would never know it with how quiet and serene the pool atmosphere is. Overall, we had a wonderful visit and would definitely stay at the Marquesa upon our return to Key West. Review #29:This was my first trip to Key West. My boyfriend visited two years ago. He stayed at a different location on Duvall Street which he said it was ok, nothing that nice, but it was clean. The place he stayed was alot more expensive too. When we arrived he said not to get too upset if it wasn't that nice. Boy were we both surprised! It looks pretty simple from the street. But once you go inside it is absolutely beautiful. The location couldn't be more perfect for all the sightseeing and nightlife. The staff is so friendly too. My only regret was that we couldn't stay longer. I'm so hoping we can return to Key West and I would not stay anywhere else but The Marquesa! Review #30:The Marquesa Hotel is perfection. It is the standard. Which is not to say you donâ€™t pay top dollar for the privilege of being a guest - you do, but it is not a regrettable expense. And while you are spending, do spring for one of the Jr. Suites. Go on - you've earned it. This visit was our second stay and certainly won't be our last. If I need to drive the point home, there is this: I am not even a particular fan of Key West, but I am a fan of the Marquesa. I'd like to say the biggest fan, but it seems that almost everyone who stays there is a repeat customer which is a positive review in itself. The Marquesa is private and quiet and clean - no spotless - and sumptuous and adult. And the staff really gives the impression taht they really love working there. And a hotel policy even gently recommends that guests avoid poolside cell phone conversations - my heroes! Review #31:Great place! Staff was awesome, rooms were perfect, overall great stay. We had junior suite #24 and it was fabulous. Pools were nice and they keep ice tea and towels out at the pool. The Cafe Marquesa next door was delicious! Every dish the table ordered was perfect and the service excellent. Could not say enough nice things about Marquesa. Book a room here with confidence. Review #32:MY wife and I are seasoned travellers from Northants in England. This beautiful hotel had all the Key West charm. We had room 9 right on the front. We had read in reviews that it could be noisy, but once we had set foot in our room/suite we didnot want to move. We would give it 5 star rating. It was light and airy from 5 sash windows and extremely well furnished. The pool area was tranquil and peaceful a little gem of an oasis one block away from the hustle and bustle of Duval Street. the staff were attentive and gave excellent service. The resteraunt was very good, but the night we went it was very noisey all the lady customers were trying to outshout each other. The rooms may be a little expensive to other hotels but worth every penny. Very highly recommended. Review #33:We just returned from our annual winter renewal trip to the Marquesa Hotel and Cafe Marquesa, marveling at how Carol and her wonderful staff keep making things better for us. Usually when you fall in love with a hotel or restaurant, you risk the very real chance of disenchantment when returning. Not only has that not happened to us in our 5 years of coming to this wonderful place, we no longer even fear it happening. As with every other visit, we find something new and delightful (in this case, poolside coffee and tea in the morning) to join the very long list of things we already adore, such as poolside ice tea during the day, wine and cheese on Saturday, beautiful decor, tropical gardens, delicious meals, and immaculate housekeeping. The best part of our visit remains the warm wlecomes and endless help from the staff, including Bob, Mary, Richard and Shaun. If heaven isn't like the Marquesa, we will be severely disappointed! Review #34:We stayed here two nights and couldn't get a third night so moved on to another hotel. This place is run beautifully. The breakfast in the courtyard is great, everything is immaculate and stylish, even the orchids are all blooming. The guests seemed a little uptight but management can't control that. For instance, one night three of us gathered on our porch at 6 pm to share wine before dinner and the woman in the adjacent room came out and said, "Could you please keep it down- we're trying to take a before dinner nap!" Not as if we were running our own karaoke machine, geez! Review #35:My wife and I stayed at the Marquesa for 2 nights. Highly recommended. Excellent service. Jr Suite was well appointed and roomy. Continental breakfast on the private porch in front of the room--easy to take. Duval Street is only 2 blocks away, so you have access to all that but a beautiful, quiet, private place to stay. Pools are small but beautiful landscaping, comfortable chairs, quiet. Dinner in the attached restaurant was very good with a nice wine list. All in all, nothing but praise for this property and the staff. Review #36:We just returned from our ten year anniversary celebration at the Marquesa. This was our 5th stay. Our first stay was when we married in Key West. The Marquesa has drastically slipped since our last visit two years ago. Our complaints are numerous. While the grounds are as lovely as ever, they have changed one of the pools into a "heated therapeutic pool". Who needs a hot pool in Key West? This forced the majority of guests to cram into the other pool. They added a flat screen tv to the room, but removed beautiful artwork and left holes unpatched in the wall. Who needs two tv's in the room, even our junior suite? They added a refrigerator in the bathroom under the sink that appeared to be circa 1970's. One night a leak sprung from the bathroom ceiling that was a result of the air conditioning drip pan overflowing. The next night wasn't much better with the air conditioner making noises like it might break at any time. We paid 400+ for this? The book of menus in the lobby contains menus for restaurants that have closed or moved from their listed locations years ago. Some menus date back to 2003 and older. Finally, we didn't expect anything special for our initial honeymoon at the Marquesa, however, after visiting repeatedly over the past ten years, any gesture would have been appreciated besides the ribbons on our table at the Cafe Marquesa for our over-priced anniversary dinner. We had a much better experience on our first visit to Morgan's Rock in Nicaragua, which we can highly recommend. Review #37:The Marquesa is a very nice, small hotel convenient to downtown but far enough away to avoid the noise and crowds. We stayed in room #1, which is a junior suite. Large, comfortable room with sitting area. Private and quiet. Landscaping on the property is very nice and pools, while small, are very nice as well. Great getaway, especially for a special occasion. Review #38:Great experience from start to finish. Wonderful historic buildings, great staff, outstanding pools and gardens. This is exactly what we were looking for when we booked our "Adult" vacation and left the children home. The Marquesa delivered on all accounts. We'll definitely stay at the Marquesa again on return trips to Key West. Review #39:We spent 6 nights at the Marquesa from July 3 to July 10. We were at the room #1 at the first floor. The room was very nice, clean , with a large bathroom and a living room (with sofa). Marquesa is con
