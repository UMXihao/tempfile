Review #0:My husband and I just stayed at the Grand Hotel this past weekend for Springfest and also to celebrate his birthday. We stay here often, several times a year, and once again had a fabulous experience. The hotel is so conveniently located, rooms are spacious and clean with fabulous views of the beach, great lobby area and coffee shop. The hotel staff is extremely friendly from the moment you call to make a reservation, during your stay, until the time you check out. The entire staff is always great to deal with, however, during this particular visit, Fay at the front desk went above and beyond to make our stay extra special. She was extremely friendly and accommodating. It was so nice to meet someone who really enjoys their job and does it well!!! When we checked out, Fay had a birthday card from the hotel and a piece of cake for my husband. Her kindness and thoughtfulness speaks volumes for the type of service you'll receive. The Grand is fortunate to have an employee as fantastic as she! You will enjoy staying here - and if you're lucky, Fay will greet you when you arrive. Review #1:The Grand Hotel has always been my favorite hotel in Ocean City. It's right on the boardwalk and near everything. I went in November alone and still had a great time. (Me Time). The spa is right in the hotel and the massage I had was just what the doctor order. You really didn't have to venture out if you didn't want to. Everything you need is in the hotel. (Spa. restaurant, lounge, indoor pool & game room along with an excerise room.) You even can do minor shopping without going outside. The rooms and views are great! Review #2:This place was great! My husband and I stayed here at the end of September on a mid-week madness special. It was worth the drive! Our room had a great view, we got a dinner coupon worth $60. The coffee shop was open all night, which was perfect for us night owls. The girls at the front desk were so much fun. They let us know about all the spots locals go to have fun. We can not wait to come back!!! ! Review #3:This was our second trip to OC. It is a very expensive destination in comparison to Virginia Beach or Myrtle Beach, but we wanted to give it a second try. We travel extensively and I always research hotels prior to making my decision. Because I felt that I had "did my homework" before choosing our hotel, I really want to share our experience. Upon check-in, the level of customer service was poor. Only 1 of 3 agents understood English and their computer system. This made for an extremely long line at 3:00. Our room was very average. It was a decent size, however the bathroom was extremely small. The door had no hooks on the back so there was no place to put your clothes. The mini-kitchen in the room was very handy; although this is standard in most beach hotel rooms. The balcony came with two chairs BUT no table. Very inconvenient. Our room was cleaned very late in the day every day but once, I had to call for housecleaning because at 5:30 they still have not come. Pros of the facility: Common areas very clean Location on boardwalk; ample parking Cons of the facility: Poor customer service No tables in pool area or on balconies Disgusting indoor pool On our third night there, the fire alarm went off at 2am and again at 7am. Is this the fault of their system, or of a stupid individual. Who knows? BUT it sure was annoying. Would we return again to OC? Definately not. The boardwalk games and rides were extremely expensive. You definately get "more for your buck" at VA Beach or Myrtle. If we were to return, my #1 choice for accommodations would be The Breaker's Hotel. We went and looked at that hotel and the staff was most pleasant and the rooms were really nice. Good luck in your vacation planning! ! Review #4:My boyfriend and I stayed at The Grand Hotel, OC MD from 08/19/2011 to 08/22/2011. This hotel, although some reviews were unfavorable, was wonderful! The view from our 6th floor room was of both the ocean and the bayside. Beautiful! The staff was friendly, the room was clean and the ammenities left nothing to be desired. Both indoor and outdoor pool, game room, spa, and the beach was steps away! You could access every store and restaurant from the inside of the hotel so the one night it rained for a while was no problem. Our balcony was large and morning coffee, listening to the waves was very relaxing. Being right on the boardwalk in OC made our stay perfect. The lobby was large- no crowds to be avoided. For those who have had complaints, I think that you should consider the value of a place that puts you in the heart of everything and offers a great nights rest in rooms that are comfortable and clean. We walked around and looked at other hotels to see up close what we had seen online....we were glad we chose the Grand Hotel. No loud parties and very family friendly if traveling with kids. We will definately stay at The Grand again and hope to return with family next year. Thanks to everyone at The Grand for a weekend getaway worthwhile! Review #5:We stayed for Memorial Weekend and we must say that we arrived early in the morning and we got our bedroom without a problem. The Room is big with Ocean View and a balcony. It was Clean OK as it was the Bathroom. We had a bikers and a church convention so the crowd was interesting for say the least at least visually. Must say that every one was respectful and we did not have any complains. The noise at night was loud, but then again it was Memorial Weekend so we were expecting it. At Check Out we had a Complimentary hour and a half so our check out was at 12:30 instead of 11:00 am. The staff told us that we could use the 2ND floor restrooms and locker to change if needed. So, we did, it was useful not extremely clean but in good shape and super useful. As mentioned before mixed feelings. The hotel was not that bad, it is outdated but then again Ocean City seems out dated as a whole! Staff was willing to accommodate and the rooms were OK. Review #6:Wish we can find a Quiet boardwalk hotel w/the pool bar luxuries & an indoor pool for emergencies. Been here 4 times due to the price (7th, 2nd, 3rd, 6th floors, least expensive room). Had a good view on the 7th floor at the end, better than the 2nd floor w/the railing blocking the view for picture taking. A bit noisy outdoors & the A/C noise was inconsistent (only hummed when it needed to reach thermostat temp). Screen door needed oiling/unrusting. Staff was professional. Apologized when they were talking too loudly at the service elevator. Honored the "please clean" sign promptly. Bed & toiletries made beautifully. At the swimming pool, staff put on the lounge coverup & gave a strong towel. Nice to have a tropical drink on the lounge chair:) Boardwalk location had a bit of room so it wasn't exactly right next to the boardwalk. Review #7:Me and my wife were checked in on sat of Sep 24 2011.As Soon as I try to check in, they didnt even had my reservation untill I show my paper comfirmation. Front desk guest service were horrible, well They don’t even say word “sorry”! it’s not that hard to say it word sorry Also, AC sound like having a big problem~ B/c I thought it was airplane engine was turned on, I could't even sleep well...personally, it was my first time staying in OC with Grand hotel, but it will be my last time...BTW... I will say one good thing is Ocean View... Review #8:They advertise in-room WiFi but I could only use my laptop in the lobby. When I called the desk they said they would look into it. That was two days ago. Restaurants and lounge aren't open and there is NO satisfactory food on site. Spa was never open as advertised. I know it's off-season, but there are lots of people here. Staff also sneak into the closed jewelry store and out of the way hallways to smoke. Very unpleasant. The view is beautiful, but that's not worth the complete absence of amenities. House-keeping is the only group that was consistently competent and professional. Next time, I'm heading down the way to Marriott. My rate was very, very low...got what I paid for. Review #9:Just wanted to say Thank you to The Grand and Christina at the front desk. We booked at another hotel and it was awful but when we went to the Grand we were able to save our week vacation. Christina at the front desk was so helpful and friendly. We will definitely be back. The room was nice, clean and spacious. The view was beautiful it was great to see the bay and the ocean. Thanks again. Review #10:I've been reading a lot of reviews on this site, that said the Grand Hotel was horrible, and to steer clear of it, but I've been staying there for six years, and never once had a problem with it. The rooms are nice, the hotel seems clean and the staff is friendly. There are two pools, which is good since neither pool is ever too crowded. I will admit the rooms are a bit dark (nothing that can't be fixed with a flip of a few switches), and the balcony isn't too private, however, it's a great location and the balcony has ample room to sit any sandy beach toys. The absolute best thing about the Grand is the parking garage, which has quite a lot of space, and is perfect, since finding parking in Ocean City, without having to walk a few blocks and crossing the busy highway isn't exactly easy. Sure, the Grand isn't anything overly special, but it's a great hotel for its price. I definitely recommend. Review #11:My family of 4 stayed at grand at was disappointed with the service of employees. Compared to previous years of staying at the hotel the staff does not speak english nor understand very well. Lazy staff and incompetent. This is my last stay here at the grand I will go to another hotel. I would pass on this hotel if you are thinking about staying here because other hotels offer better amenties than this one for the price Review #12:Just got home from staying at the Grand Hotel in O.C. and can't wait to go back! The staff from front desk to maids to pool attendants to GM-Patrick were awesome. The rooms are very spacious and the kitchenette was perfect. The view from the room was beautiful even though we didn't have a "direct view" room. We lost our car keys on the second day there and General Manager Patrick went above and beyond to get us a replacement key from a dealership 30 minutes away. I highly recommend staying here and if I could I would give them 6 stars! Review #13:Our recent stay at The Grand Hotel in Ocean City, MD was good but not exceptional. The big plus was that the room was ocean front. In fact, all of the rooms are ocean front so if this is something that it important to you, than this is the place. The price was definitely reasonable for an ocean front stay. However, the ad on their website did promise free Wi-Fi and that was pretty much non existent unless of course you wanted to spend your time in the lobby. The rooms were decent but it would have been nice if they had at the very least a larger refrigerator. The food choice at the Terrace Restaurant was breakfast only and it was only an option Thurs-Sun which was a bit strange. The lounge, pool bar and exercise room were fairly nice and easily accessible. The front desk staff were rather uninformed which wasn't helpful when spending a vacation in a tourist city. Overall, the experience at The Grand was good but when we go back next time, I think we'll give another hotel a try. Review #14:This was a great hotel. Located on the boardwalk, oceanfront was wonderfull. Room was very clean. This is the second time we stayed this summer. Room was very large. Nice size balcony. Little kitchenette had plenty of cabinet space & countertop. Bathroom, beds & carpet was very clean. This end of the boardwalk was very quite & away from the crowd. You leave the hotel & walk across the boardwalk & right down to the beach. Very convenient. We plan to go back in September which will make it the third time this summer. So it must be a very nice place to stay because we would not keep coming back if it wasn't. The only thing that wasn't that great was the breakfast in the restaurant. Will eat somewhere else next time. The bar had great pina collattas. Review #15:This hotel has a great location and the way its shaped we got a room with views of both ocean and bayside. There is a cute tiki bar at the pool, but they don't offer pool side service which would make it better. They have alot of amenties in this hotel including a pizza place which is open until midnight and a 24hr cafe. We would def recommend this hotel to others and would come back again! Review #16:Pros: Room looks like online photo…pleasant surprise, met expectations Room is spacious…comfortably housed two adults, a teen and a pre-teen Management was responsive to wi-fi issues Housekeeping was very responsive to requests for additional towels and washcloths No problem finding a parking space in garage Great location (far enough away from the main section of the boardwalk, but close enough) Side view room still gave great view of the beach / ocean Easy beachfront access Overall, a comfortable environment Cons: Sliding door to balcony an issue – way too heavy that my 11 year old could not slide it open (addressed here by management; apparently these are being replaced). General housekeeping was just okay – in and out of the room in no time flat Only two plastic chairs on balcony – not comfortable for enjoying the beautiful ocean view (even from our side room) or people-watching Charge for room safe (What’s next? Charging for use of the TV or toilet?) Would I return to the Grand Hotel? Most likely! And note to Management: if my car key / remote is found, please let me know (details left with front desk). Thanks! Review #17:We have stayed at the Grand Hotel for 6 years in a row. We love the ocean view. The place is clean and the rooms are very nice and big. The location is great because it is close to all the things my family likes to do at the beach. Phillips restaurant is only a half block away. Right across the street is a new Dairy Queen and Candy Kitchen. Miniature golf is only about a block away. And our favorite breakfast place, Happy Jacks, is only about 2 blocks away. We did notice this year that it is getting time for remodeling. A hotel of this type asking around $300 a night should try to stay fresh and new. (Hopefully the owners and managers read these reviews.) The furnishing are starting to look dated. They need to upgrade to flat screen TVs. The furniture, since it is laminate and not real wood, is really starting to show wear. The bar on the sliding door was broken and missing pieces. When my husband sat in one of the green plastic chairs on the balcony, it broke. They are getting weather worn and brittle and in need of replacing. We love the Grand Hotel. We recommend it to family and friends and will return next year! Review #18:This hotel is great for someone who wants to be close to the action but not in the action . You can walk right to the beach and if it is raining there is the option of the indoor pool. The hotel has lots to offer such as a 24hr sweet eatery and there is a bar and spa. Where the hotel lacks is the actual room. The room is clean but not updated. So a little bit of a renovation is due. They room needs new curtains, carpet and the mattress was just ok...my husband did not get a good sleep but I slept ok. My 15yr old son snored loudly and slept as if he was home. The service was good. The front dest was friendly and helpful. It gets three stars for location if it was not for that it would have been two stars. More than likely this family would not return. We will ttry another hotel. Review #19:Stayed here for a family beach weekend this summer. It will be our new home for trips to OCMD. The hotel is located on the boardwalk but, unlike other hotels closer to the attractions, it's not like playing a game of Frogger to cross to the beach. It was within easy walking distance to everything we needed - restaurants, snacks, miniature golf - and a very doable walk down to the end of the boardwalk. A bonus is that it's the only round hotel so it's easy to spot when walking the beach or boards. Our room was clean and spacious with a great ocean view. There's no privacy between balconies on the lower floors so sitting outside can be awkward. The upper floors appeared to have screens to remedy that. The 2nd floor rooftop pool was fantastic with a full bar and towel service. We were there several times each day for a dip. See you next summer, Grand Hotel! Review #20:Stayed here while attending an event at the convention center. The Grand Hotel is located nicely and my room (1105) had a wonderful southern view of the boardwalk and beach. The large room with two queen beds was comfortable and quiet. The refrigerator was convenient, and the hotel staff are very responsive. I booked anextra room for my hospitality suite one night and the staff cleared out the beds and replaced the beds with rounds and chairs for my guests. Even the California Cheesteak in the pizzaria on the gound floor was of special quality. I will certainly return! Review #21:We usually go to Myrtle Beach every year and this year we thought we would try something different. What a mistake that was. When we made reservations, we asked about their entertainment and we were told that "there is something going on here every night". They ACTUALLY had entertainment on Friday and Saturday nights only. The restraunt was closed for 2 days for a private party. Just as well though because the doors to it were filthy with fingerprints all week long so we wouldnt have eaten there anyway. The lounges, restraunts, pool bar, pizza parlor and the shops were all owned by a third party and you could not charge food or drinks to your room. (I guess they thought people go swimming with their cash and credit cards in their pockets). I asked about smoking in the lounge and instead of saying "I'm sorry sir but Maryland state law prohibits smoking inside" The bartender instead said "If you want to smoke, go outside". There were kids skateboarding in the parking garage all day Thursday, .although there was a sign saying NO SKATEBOARDING. My concern was one of them losing control and hitting my motorcycle. We also looked for the hot tub as we thought for sure that a place that called themselves a resort would have one. We were wrong. It seemed to me as if after we checked in and they billed my charge card, that's all they cared about. For over 250.00 per night, the management team should visit Myrtle Beach resorts and learn customer relations from them. Review #22:I stayed at the Grand with my wife and two kids. Our room was extremely large and comfortable compared to most hotels in the area. We were able to thrown down a blow up mattress and still have plenty of room to move around. The ice machine was right outside my door and I never heard a peep late at night. The rooms seem to be very quite and soundproof compared to other hotels I have stayed in. We did not use the pools, but they seemed well maintained to me. The beach outside of the hotel is the best selling point - it's GRAND!!! When compared to staying in other locations in Ocean City, the beach at this location is very large and accommodates large crowds without making you feel like a sardine. The front desk staff was very friendly and helped with any issues and/or questions we had. Yes, I'll be back... Review #23:We checked in and were expecting a "nice" ocean view; however, our room was on the crappy 2nd floor. We could barely see the ocean due to the 1st floor shops and the restricting balcony. If you are staying, request a room 3rd floor or above. The 2nd floor's ice machine was also broken. We rode to the 12th (top) floor to get ice and everyone was complaining up there because it was so hot on the 12th floor. No free breakfast here, but you can go to the coffee shop where you will pay $5.50 for a latte or $2.75 for a cup of black coffee. Upon entering our room, there was fecal matter that was "left behind" from the previous guests. It was awful and disgusting, on the side of the toilet. Disappointed in the house keepers. I also would have to agree with a previous reviewer--the pillows are terrible, so bring your own or request 12 extras at check in. I had to ask 3 times for 4 extra pillows. They weren't too happy with me. Very outdated furniture and television. I guess that's why the price is so-so. I would highly recommend staying elsewhere. This was my first and last time at the Grand. Review #24:My husband and I stayed the Memorial Day Weekend and it was very pleasant. We had a wonderful view of the ocean. The room was clean and our maid service was very good. It was nice being right there on the boardwalk, didn't need your car to get anywhere. The room was very large and the bed was comfortable. The staff was very helpful and I would recommend this hotel to anyone Review #25:Every year my family goes to OC in January and again in March for the children's birthdays. We always book two rooms for my sister's family and my own. We had just checked into the Grand, with minor problems, we always request adjoining rooms and that seems to be a small problem for this hotel, but, the fire alarm and sprinkler system had gone off on our floor and to be precise in the room right next to mine and my sisters, we waited patiently while the staff was in the room where the sprinkler originally went off, the carpeting in our rooms were soaked as was some of our luggage and kids toys, etc. We waited about 1/2 hour and I finally went and asked one of the staff what to do about our rooms, they barely made eye contact as they sent me to the front desk. Once at the front desk, they acted as though it was my problem, after some convincing they gave us two new rooms, but, made no gesture to help us move our luggage or belongings, When I told the manager it would be nice to be comped an additional nights stay either during this stay or for our stay that was pending for March. They told me that they could not do that. We booked two rooms at the very least (4) times a year and they could not offer any compensation for our inconvenience. I was very very disappointed in management at that point and we have begun staying at a different resort at the Ocean. Review #26:My husband, granddaughter and I just spent a wonderful week at the Grand Hotel in Ocean City Maryland. We have been coming to Ocean City for the past 14 years for the Maryland State Fire Association Convention and I think this is the best place that we have stayed! Our room was very spacious and clean. The staff were very friendly and courteous. Our 6 year old granddaughter loved the indoor pool. We spent a lot of time at the outdoor pool which was very nice. Several of our friends who belong to our local fire department stayed at the Grand and they too were very satisfied. We will definitely be back again next year! Review #27:Just got back from our Ocean Ciy vacation today. We stayed at the Grand this year. After having a less than grand time there in 2008 (anyone who has read my tirade after our July '08 vacation knows what I'm talking about) we took a break and stayed somewhere else last year. We came back to the Grand because the location is perfect. I must say that I am glad we did!!! Check in was a breeze, we got the floor we wanted, the view was FANTASTIC (we had more of an ocean view than we ever had before). How lovley to lay in bed and see the ocean!! The hotel was clean, staff was very friendly and helpful. There MUST have been a change of management. A change for the good!!! I will be happy to again recommend The Grand! ! Review #28:I want to start out by saying the housekeeping staff was very timely and efficient. The hotel is nice, and on the quieter end of the boardwalk, but needs to finish updating rooms. Especially needs knew sliding doors, (among other improvements) that are not fogged and you can open and close without a struggle. There is a lack of communication between employees at the hotel front desk, we received different check-in information from different employees, which was a little frustrating and confusing. Also, one of the front desk managers, Nina, needs to work on her people skills. A manager can be an efficient manager or be an efficient manager with interpersonal skills. As far as achieving those skills, that would depend on how much of a priority good customer service is to that manager and to the hotel. Review #29:When my group arrived to start our golf vacation, we were thoroughly impressed. The rooms were beautiful, the staff was great, and the ammenities were spectacular. I booked this hotel since it was on the boardwalk. I never realized all that the Grand Hotel had to offer. We enjoyed the nightclub, which made it alot safer for us to enjoy a few cocktails after our rounds of golf. The 24 hour coffee shop was a delight all by itself. This is the place that we all would gather in the morning get a cup of coffee and then get on the road to our golf course destination. Iwould strongly recommend the Grand Hotel to everyone I know and any and all who ask me where to stay while in Ocean City. I am putting together another golf trip for my gang of misfits and the Grand Hotel is at the top of the list for accomodations. Review #30:My husband and I stayed at the Grand Hotel on 21st St on 3/29/2012. I had won a contest at the Grand and received a room upgrade as my gift, so when I booked the room, Matt Brown at the Grand gladly upgraded my room to direct oceanfront. I also had asked for a high floor and they again accomodated my request. When we checked in, we were greeted by Erin who was very sweet and competent, and she even called our room a short while later to see if we were satisfied and if there was anything we needed. Very few hotels do this any more, even the so called "upscale" hotels in OC. Our room was a 2 queen with efficiency kitchen, dining area, and bathroom. The room was very large, very clean and nicely kept up. The cabinets in the kitchen appeared to be new as well. My only issues were that the mattresses were a bit soft and had wells when we slept, and the bathroom was a bit smaller than we would have liked, but it was clean and satisfactory. The oceanfront balconies on all floors except the top three have open balconies so there is no privacy if that's important to you. I think the reason for this is to give everyone the best possible view considering that the hotel is basically a half circle. I didn't have the chance to try the spa or pools, but our stay was very nice and I would stay there again. Thank you Grand for such a nice stay. Review #31:I'm a 54 year old woman who went for a week in July with my mother as a special birthday treat for myself. The first night (Saturday) we were on the 2nd floor and the noise was horrible. Doors slamming, people yelling in nearby rooms, etc. Sunday we asked to be moved and apparently there was only one room available at "our rate" and we would be called when it was available. We waited all day, checking in occasionally to see if we could move and for some reason it took until my 5:30 call to get the other room. That was basically 2 days of my vacation! Then the voice mail didn't work, the iron didn't work (took two calls and several hours to get an iron!) Amenities were not left by the cleaning service so we had to track down the maid's cart several times to get shampoo, etc. I wrote to the hotel with my complaint and received no reply. I wrote to the management company and received no reply. Bottom line is I spent over $1,400 for the room, money in the restaurant, money in the salon and money in the shops. Next time I'll know better and spend my money where I am appreciated as a customer. Review #32:3 months ago, i booked my vacation with the grand. i originally wanted a regular room with direct ocean view. i later found out that one was available, but jacuzzi suits had direct ocean view. so i spent the extra money and booked that room. when i had checked in i had their first room, all the way to the right. barely any view, most of the view was there parking lot. i called front desk and they changed me over 6 rooms? why couldn't that be done earlier? .. note (this happened the previous year as well). after one night at the hotel we find out that the plumbing in the room was not working, then later found out the whole 12th floor had a problem, water had no pressure to make it to the 12th floor, water toilets would just stop. General Manager, told me they would fix it. 5 days 4 nights later same problem was happening, water would stop for up to 30 sec. He sent me a bottle of Champagne that i spit out because it was probably a $3.99 bottle. No refund, no refund/partial discount, nothing. Is this normal did i pay more for this? Not to mention the staff are all college/ foreign exchange students who barely speak the language. This will be my last time at this hotel, i have been going to ocean city for 15 yrs. now and will try the Marriot (brand new ), Hilton (expensive but worth it) or the Holiday in Suit (which is in- between the two). P.S. not to mention the complimentary FIRE ALARM EVACUATION AT 10:30 p.m., looks like another reoccurring problem the "GRAND" has put aside to fix. Review #33:Once again another fab weekend here !! The storm came through and was wonderful to see from the amazing view point of the 8th floor. And the next day glorious sunshine, blue skys and sea !! Just breath taking. Service was impeccable as always !! The kids had such fun at the pool !! And they were tuckered out after so weactually got some rest ;) Thanks to the Grand Family ! ! Review #34:This hotel may have once been "grand" but the time has passed. The rooms are large but lacking in amenities. The mattress feels old and the pillows flat. Instead of sitting at the desk to work, I had to hover by the door to my room to connect to the Internet. The balconies do not have solid dividers so you are looking into your neighbor's space and the "furniture" on the balconies consists of cheap plastic chairs. The view of the ocean is beautiful but, unfortunately, I couldn't see it because there was condesation trapped inside the sliding door and blocking any view out. There was even an envelope requesting a tip for the maids! I'm not sure about the value for the money issue as I was not paying for the room but the hotel left much to be desired. I have to believe there are better places to stay in OC. Review #35:I last stayed at The Grand in Aug of 2009. The last time I stayed, I booked an ocean front room. I like to look out of the balcony and people watch or listen to the waves crash at night. This time around I booked my vacation late and there weren't any ocean front rooms available. We had an ocean view room which you can still see the ocean and the boardwalk from. Everything was pretty much the same as last time. The rooms clean, the staff is friendly, the pool is a little on the smaller side but the outside pool bar is fantastic. The one issue I had was some of the other guest. On both sides of our room we had loud quest. They came in at night at very early hours, obviously drunk and rowdy. Two doors down, a guest had passed out drunk in his chair on the balcony. The ocean front rooms are only about $10 more a night and I would of gladly spent the extra money to not have to deal with that nonsense. My assumption is that a better class of people would stay at the ocean front rooms. Its not something that the hotel can really control (who stays there) and it was just a minor annoyance. Not something I would hold against the hotel itself. Its still a pretty good hotel situated right on the boardwalk, great location, fairly clean rooms, friendly staff and awesome pool bar. Review #36:My wife and I and two kids stayed at the Grand for a quick family weekend in OC. The views of the ocean, boardwalk and bay were great (by the shape of the hotel it seems that all of the rooms would have a nice view). I also like the location, it is on the boardwalk so you can get to the pier easily but not too close to the craziness. Our room was clean and very spacious (ours had a nice counter/sink with fridge/etc and a large balcony). The front desk person was friendly and the kids enjoyed the arcade/indoor pool. It was in April so the outdoor pool was closed but it seemed like it would be nice place to hang out, there was a nice poolside bar. The rate was compettiive, everyone liked it, we will definately stay there next time we are in OC. Review #37:I am surprised to see some of the bad reviews written on this page! My wife and I (and our neigh
