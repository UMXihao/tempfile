Review #0:In February we returned to the Wedgewood Hotel for a four day stay. Our previous stay at the Wedgewood - just prior to them being awarded a rating as a place to stay by Conde Naste - was tremendous. Unfortunately the hotel seems to have lost its star status- or at least that was our experience. The lobby and the room were needing some care and attention. Obviously the hotel has recognized this as the major problem we experienced was due to renovation. Construction and painting were going on in the room next to ours. A strong smell of paint persisted in our room throughout our four day stay - even over a weekend. When a complaint was made after the first night the staff sent up a machine intended to clean the air, we were told not to be in the room while it was on. We needed to keep the window open when we were in the room resulting in a cold stay. Vancouver was not warm in February. We were not provided with an option of moving rooms - despite this being a four day stay. In addition there was noise throughout the day so a little nap in the afternoon during the holiday was out of the question. Guests should be advised that construction is taking place prior to booking. The prices of the Wedgewood have risen over the years as the hotel has been discovered. Our experience in 2006 does not support the reputation that the hotel now enjoys. Perhaps the renovations will help to keep the hotel at the top but in the meantime guests should be informed that the construction may impact on their comfort and enjoyment. Review #1:My husband and I were sadly disappointed in this hotel, after I read rave reviews about how fantastic this hotel was and there is none like it in B.C. I planned this trip for our fifth year anniversary and wanted to be pampered. The spa was excellent, but I truly could not understand how this hotel could be rated above 3-star. We paid for a suite, which was over $350/US nightly, so, we expected five star service, food and accommodations. The service was lack luster, the room was very clean but definitely not fancy. The food, which for dinner we paid over $100 to eat in our room, not including drinks, was so-so. One great aspect which stood out in my mind, was the housekeeping supervisor. Our bed was awful so when we called the following day, she switched out our bed with the only pillow top in the hotel. We were thankful for her consideration, but decided to cut our trip short. We left two days earlier than scheduled and ended up spending our last two days at our favorite hotel, Bellevue Club in Bellevue, WA. We spent half the money we did in Bellevue and received two times the service, food quality and comfortable night stay. If you are used to four+ star hotels, you may want to continue looking before plunking down the four-star money here! Review #2:Comfy and quiet. The staff were super friendly and knowledgeable. I think this is the first time I've been to a hotel and couldn't find ANYTHING to complain about. Everything worked! and everything was nice and clean. The complimentary chocolates and cookies were a very nice touch and a BIG bathtub for two, not in the bathroom, but IN the room itself. The hotel restaurant, Bacchus, had delicious food and good staff. Can't say enough good about this hotel. Review #3:The Wedgewood is our hotel of choice whenever we come to Vancouver. The location is great - a five minute walk (or less) to Pacific Centre, Robson street, the Art Gallery and great restaurants. It is a gem in a busy city - always a pleasure to return to after a busy day of shopping and sightseeing. The lounge is fantastic - intimate and urban, with really good food and drink. The rooms are tastefully decorated and very clean. Extra touches, such as free bottled water and cookies are appreciated. The service is consistently good at the Wedgewood. Mark, who checked us in on this last visit, was great - friendly and attentive. He recommended a great restaurant to us (Coast). We look forward to our next stay at this wonderful hotel. Review #4:My family stayed at the Wedgewood in June, on the way to and from an Alaskan cruise. The hotel was beautiful and charming, and we really enjoyed our stay. We had an adjoining room for the kids- they slept on the pull-out couch. We did request an extra cot since the kids are teenagers and didn't relish sharing a bed, but there were not any cots or roll-away beds. The kids especially loved the turn down service with the cookies. The location of the hotel is excellent, we were able to access many activities easily. We had one breakfast and one dinner at the hotel's restaurant. The food was very good, presented well and the price was expensive but fair. We thought the decor of the room was very nice, comfortable and inviting. The front desk staff was generally great- although there was one woman that was exceptionally helpful, going out of her way to help us with all of our requests (even one request of finding a store to get a broken watch repaired was fulfilled within minutes). There was another woman that worked at the front desk who was a bit aloof and stern, but was professional. We would definitely stay here again if we visit this beautiful city in the future. Review #5:After reading many of the reviews for this hotel and others in Vancouver we decided to stay at the Wedgewood. It seemed that hands down it received the best over all reviews. Years ago we had stayed at Sutton Place and really liked it, but the reviews lead us to believe that it was not as nice as it was in the late 80's and 90's. I had gone on line to look at the rooms at the Wedgewood and did think they looked a little "tired" but decided to stay there anyway because we like small hotels and booked a junior suite. Needless to say, we were very disappointed with the tired, outdated rooms and bathroom. There were no towel racks to hang the towels on in the small bathroom and the cheap oversized plastic waste paper basket was wedged between the toilet and the toilet paper holder. The tv in the bedroom was situated high in the corner of the bedroom on the type of platform you would find in a hospital room. And the room safe was from another era altogether. Also when we were checking out of our room we dediced not to call the bellman as our two bags were on wheels. However we forgot that there are stairs leading down to reception from the eleavators (why they don't have a ramp, especially for a handicap person, makes no sense) and as we were going down the stairs (with a bellman just standing there) my husband's bag ended up falling down the stairs, breaking the handle. The hotel was clean and the bed comfortable, and I think that with a major renovation this could be a lovely hotel, but I know I will not stay there again in it's present condition. Review #6:We had an absolutely wonderful stay at the Wedgewood. The staff were extremely friendly, courteous and professional - nothing was too much trouble. Our room was fabulous - wonderful big bed, amazing bath, and a lovely balcony with great views out over the city. A highlight was an amazing English Afternoon tea which was better than any I've had at the Ritz in London. We wouldn't stay anywhere else in Vancouver. Review #7:Our room was beautiful and the housekeeping service was impeccable but I have to say I was not impressed with the rest of the staff and for this reason I will probably not stay there again. I would expect the staff of a hotel of this caliber to provide excellent customer service and I agree with another reviewer that the front of house staff seemed young and not polished. When we arrived by Taxi we carried our bags into the hotel while the kid working the valet stayed at his stand. Not once during our stay did the gentlemen working the valet open the door for us and greet us. All we received was a smile as they continued to talk to each other about there personal lives. The front desk/concierge staff were cordial but did not go out of there way to make us feel welcome. In contrast when we went to the Wickaninnish Inn in Torfino they went out of their way to make us feel welcome. When we arrived they met our taxi offloaded our luggage and brought it to the check in desk. The person who cehcked us in then escorted us to our room and informed us about the particulars of our room, the hotel, and the area. Every time we would leave or arrive they would open the door and would ask us how our day was and if there is anything we needed. When we would ask the concierge about an activity or restaurant she would offer to book a reservation. The morning we left they had coffee waiting for us at check out. That is what I would have expected from the Wedgewood. Review #8:From the moment that we walked in to the Wedgewood it was a fantastic experience. The valet was efficient and we were checked in very speedily. The room was lovely, clean and well furnished. The bathroom was great. No detail was too small, down to the nice toiletries and great quality coffee. In the evening, there was water and cookies and a turn down service. Dinner in Bacchus was a treat, the food was excellent with a relaxed ambience. Our stay included the continental breakfast which was nice. Looks like they have a pretty good gym and the spa looks lovely. The location is great and near to the heart of Vancouver with all its attractions and good shopping. The courtesy, professionalism and warmth exuded by all the staff was exemplary...loved the total attention to detail. Will certainly be coming back again...very, very highly recommended. Congratulations to the staff at the Wedgewood...awesome! Review #9:Picked the Wedgewood Hotel for a short Vancouver vacation based on reviews here as well as Yelp.com. The Wedgewood is a smaller boutique hotel nestled among some stiff competition. The location is very central to Vancouver, once you get your bearings it's very doable to walk most places. Our room was on the 12th floor with a larger than you might expect veranda. The veranda had several large potted plants, round glass table and 4 chairs. A nice place to have a coffee in the AM or a cocktail in the afternoon. The bed was comfortable, room was equipped with a flat screen TV, and wifi is provided. Room as well as the rest of the hotel are tastefully decorated. Evening turn down included two fresh cookies every evening. The highlight of the Wedgewood was the staff. Every single staff member we encountered was friendly and very helpful. This type of service really set the Wedgewood apart from the majority of hotels we've stayed in (at this price point). If you stay here you won't be disappointed. Review #10:We chose to stay here for our first few nights in Canada on our honeymoon. We could not have picked a better place. The service was incredible. Everyone is so friendly. My husband bought a baseball bat and ball and was even offered a game- it totally won him over!! The rooms were large, comfy and very clean. We had a large balcony and enjoyed looking down on the bustling street. We loved this place so much we came back two more times during our road trip!!! I would absolutely stay here again. Review #11:We stayed at this delightful hotel for 3 nights in September, 2006 just before boarding our cruise ship. It is in a wonderful position, close to all the shops and we were given a lovely front room. We had a weekend package with bed and breakfast which we felt was good value. The only downside was that we ate in their Bacchus Restaurant one night and we felt the meal was rushed. We were out within 45 minutes which to us was far too rapid. We do like to linger over a meal especially when we are paying top dollar. That is our only criticism of a great hotel. Review #12:Visiting family in Vancouver this year we decided to spend a few nights at the Wedgewood....what a delight! This hotel came highly recommended and we were not disappointed very friendly staff who always had a smile, lively bar & restaurant and just lovely rooms. We did not get a room overlooking Robson Square but it didn't matter this place is all about quality, bed linens, marble showers, soaker tubs, furniture and the most comfortable beds. One nice touch is the business center on the second floor, good speed computers are available for guests use at no extra charge, we could stay in touch with our family back in the UK daily without worrying about being charged a fortune. Very well done to everyone at the Wedgewood we will return. Review #13:The Wedgewood Hotel is one of my favourite places to be! When it comes to service, value, atmosphere, professional/friendly staff, large, well equipped rooms, you will not find a better hotel. From the moment you enter the front lobby you can feel the pressures of your day wash away. We always enjoy the service and food quality at The Bacchus lounge and restaurant. (The restaurant is on the higher end but for a special occasion it is the best!) The hotel is very central to all that Vancouver has to offer! Review #14:I stayed at the Wedgewood Hotel for 5 nights in February 2005 with my husband and my baby son. I have stayed in many great hotels before and I must say that the Wedgewood has been one of the best; I would not hesitate to go back. The room was perfect, with all the commodities but with an extra touch (we stayed in one of the Wedgewood Suites - greatly reduced rates in the winter months! ), the service was outstanding (the staff was great with our 18 months old son even though this was clearly not a place where many babies get taken) and the location couldn't be better (right in the middle of all the shops and restaurants in Downtown Vancouver). The little touches we appreciated: being given a private area in the Bacchus restaurant and bar lounge so that we could sip some cocktails while keeping our son with us (children are not admitted in the main bar), the amazing room service (great food from the Bacchus restaurant - the desserts are a pure delight - and the service is faultless), the unexpected baby toiletries in the room, the best blueberry pancakes I've ever tasted and the complementary Belgium chocolates and nightly freshly baked cookies. I did not get to try the spa which I regret and the gym room is a bit small but it does have all the usual required equipment. There is no swimming pool which is a shame but I really don't see where they could fit one anyway. I loved the Bacchus restaurant - for Breakfast, you get to sit in big comfortable armchairs by the fireplace (with a roaring fire in it in the winter!). Although we didn't get to eat there in the evenings because of our son's bedtimes, the restaurant certainly was very popular, always full, with live piano music every night. We had the opportunity to sample the food via Room Service and it was excellent. Review #15:The Wedgewood is a wonderful hotel in every respect. The rooms are lovely. The service is impeccable. The location is great. We arrived at the hotel before check-in time and our room was not ready. The woman at the desk suggested some places of interest nearby, and I asked some questions about some of the attractions we planned to visit during our stay. When we returned to the hotel a few hours later, this woman had taken the initiative during our absence to gather some information about the sights I'd asked about, and print the public transportation routes off the internet. That was a great service touch. Our room was beautiful and well appointed. Staff went out of their way during our stay to make sure we had everything we needed. The bar area is wonderful-- a great place to start with breakfast in the morning and end the evening with a nightcap. For those who, like me, prefer an elegant boutique hotel to a sterile chain, the Wedgewood is the perfect spot in Vancouver. Review #16:Stayed at the Wedgewood for 5 nights on our recent holiday and whilst it was the most expensive accomodation of our hols it was well worth the money. As said by others the little touches such as cookies and the chocolates on arrival make the place stick in the memory. Great location just off Robson Street makes everywhere walkable in a city that is a joy to walk around. Also had a meal in the hotel restaraunt "Bachus" which was excellent, i'd recommend going for a meal even if your not staying at the hotel, great food in elegant surroundings. All in all a very enjoyable stay in a hotel that has the peresonal touch. On a previous visit we stayed in the Fairmont Waterfront which is another fantastic hotel but i think the Wedgewood pips it for it's little touches as well as it's great rooms. Review #17:My husband and I walked into the Wedgewood after leaving the hotel we had booked (the Opus, which was horrible). We were at the end of a long business travel swing, and wanted somewhere that would work for us both for business and for relaxing. The Wedgewood is definitely quirky--the decor is so dated it's new again (high late-sixties-to-early-seventies), the gym teeny, the bar so retro it's got a piano guy. I had seen pictures of the rooms online, and had my doubts about the in-room tubs. but the rooms were spotless, the service excellent, the location great. prices weren't bad, either. we booked a suite; it's been perfect, comfortable and cozy and spacious and very very very quiet and well-maintained. Staff members are friendly and professional, too. The phone lines are a bit crackly, and there's no ipod docking station (though there are flat-screen tvs) but there's a lot of thoughtfulness and comfort here. Review #18:Just got back from a 4 night stay at the Wedgewood, and was almost sad to leave the hotel. The bed was beautiful, big, and so comfortable. The room and the bathroom were roomy. The toiletries are wonderfully scented. I'd read all about the welcome box of truffles and the nightly cookies and water along with turndown service, but it still felt like a special treat. The location was ideal, truly in the heart of a great and very walk-able downtown. We had a great view from a 10th floor room. I must say that we don't generally stay at places that are this highly rated, so my expectations maybe aren't as high as people who frequently stay at places like this. We got such a GREAT rate as part of their winter discounts, that we almost felt guilty about it :) The staff was personable and very helpful the couple of times we needed directions, or help making reservations (but again we weren't very demanding people). One major thing I noted is that we very rarely heard other guests while in our room. We could hear a door close every now and then, but other than that it felt like we had the entire floor to ourselves. It was a nice surprise because often we feel like a lot of hotels have paper-thin walls. Oh if you stay here, do yourself a favor and book a dinner at the Bacchus restaurant (part of the hotel). It's an expensive restaurant but it is worth every penny. Superb service and even better food. Overall, a great experience and we hope they will run more off-season deals so that we have the opportunity to stay there again. Review #19:My husband and I have just returned from 3 nights at the Wedgewod hotel in Vancouver. It was pure luxury in the executive king suite with balcony. It even had a bar in the room with bar stools. The facilities were exceptional including a giant size soak tub for 2. Comfortable, clean, great service, excellent lounge bar for cocktails and good restaurant. My only comment is that the restaurant is quite formal but do go at least once - the food is excellent. Review #20:Based in the centre of Vancouver with the harbour 7 blocks to the left and the beach 7 blocks to the right of the main entrance. A perfect central location for exploring Vancouver. A very plush hotel. Specious elegant rooms. Excellent service. The staff were very courteous. Review #21:Over the years, I have stayed at the Wedgewood a few times for both business and pleasure. This past November, my husband and I stayed here for a long weekend, and we enjoyed this hotel a fair amount. The location is very good - near the art gallery, shopping, and walking distance (or a short cab ride) to many restaurants. However, we both felt the hotel is in need of some renovation. It's not changed in a decade (at least, possibly longer), and some of the fixtures and decore are dated. Also, our room was near the elevator, despite having asked for a quiet room. This was a disappointment. Still, the service was very good, and our room had a nice view of the park. We enjoyed our time, but would in the future likely choose a hotel that was either built for or updated as a result of the Olympics. I wouldn't recommend this hotel for families. I did not use the gym, but my husband did. He said it that calling it a gym is a stretch - more of a work-out bathroom really. Review #22:stayed at the wedgewood for 5 nights and can not praise it enough from check in after a long flight to a very early morning check out everything was great,lovely suite with some nice touches(biscuits and sherry on arrival) homemade cookies and bottled water each night. room service was good and had a great meal in the bacchus restaurant quite pricey but not too expensive for a special treat, location was very central but vancouver is not an enormous city and we found it very walkable.All in all we would go again and be happy to stay at the wedgewood. Review #23:Three girlfriends and I spoiled ourselves with spa services and room service during our stay! What a treat to get out of town with great friends and then get treated like royalty at Wedgewood Hotel & Spa! Can't wait til our next getaway. I may even make reservations to take my husband back for a romantic weekend. Review #24:Tired and overpriced. We had a mid floor “suite.” Suite is a misnomer. The room was old and tired. The tv in the bedroom was bolted to the ceiling. The tv in the sitting area, was a beat-up old RCA. The bedroom part of the “suite” was cramped. Rather than a door separating the rooms, there was a stained thick tapestry/window curtain. The furniture was old and tired. The walls were dreary, dank and simply depressing. Service was not up to par for the price. The recommendation for a dinner was awful – don’t rely on the concierge. Overall DEFINITLEY NOT at all worth the price charged. Also, the garbage trucks that frequent the ally are loud. Look elsewhere. Something good – the chocolates that they leave for you are delicious. Review #25:Well presented hotel. Rooms are clean and the staff are very friendly. Good location for downtown Vancouver. Lots of positives. Make sure you get a room at the front (overlooking Hornby St) as a room to the rear has a terrible view and the noise from the alley below starts at 5:30am. Overall, would recommend for a short stay. Review #26:The Bacchus bar/lounge/restaurant is so civilized. I find this type of boutique hotel charming and as a single for the most part traveller I feel very safe here. It is a perfect location. The welcome box of chocolates are superb and the evening turndown with cookies and water is so nice. Review #27:This was our 5th stay at this hotel in the last 2 years. We always stay in the deluxe executive,and it is first class, (especially for romantic escapes). The hotel is perfectly located just off of robson street, which is perfect for shopping and checking out downtown restaurants. The executive room is spacious, well lit, and the bathtub for two in the corner of the room is spectacular. We try to book when the free valet parking and breakfast at Baccus. We have stayed at many downtown hotels (pan pacific, wall centre, sutton place) but this is the best of the lot, and we will continue to stay there. On one of our stays, the hotel didn't live up to the bar they had set for themselves. I contacted the manager, and he pleaded with us to let them make it up to us, and make it up they did, in a BIG way.. The whole Wedgewood experience starts when you walk into the warm, inviting lobby. As you get off the elevator, the hallways smell of spiced pot pouri. The hotel rooms are very clean, and I would recommend this place to anyone wanting a romantic getaway... Review #28:We recently stayed at the Wedgewood for four nights while visiting Vancouver. It's a wonderful and quiet place to come home to after a long day of hiking and sightseeing. A little bit older and more sedate than the larger hotels but that is part of its charm. The staff is very helpful and accomodating. A suggestion - if you are thinking of going to Whistler for the day, Avis is only one block away and it is an easy drive. They open at 7:00am and have late night drop off arrangements. You can stay at the Wedgewood and still have a full day in Whistler without changing hotels. Special rates are sometimes available for the Wedgewood and, if you can find one, you can stay in a nice luxury boutique hotel for about the same price or only a little more than the mass market ones the cruise lines use. Review #29:We spent time in Vancouver for the weekend. The hotel was amazing. Beautiful decor, clean, and tasteful. The staff were very hospitable and professional. The restaurant was amazing! Food was great! Have to try it. The room was very spacious and well appointed with high quality linens. Location was perfect. It was a quick walk to everything. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone. Review #30:Vancouver has so many great hotel options that it was difficult to choose. We chose the Wedgewood because it ranked high with Trip Advisor AND because it was recommended by two different couples we ran into while traveling who are Vancouver locals. From the moment you arrive at the entry untilnthe day you depart you are treated as a celebrity. We had a King Suite for a week as this was a special 25 th Anniversary celebration. Vancouver was our original honeymoon destination so we were excited to return. Wow! This is a boutique hotel. The rooms are lovely and comfortable. The bed pillows were awesome as were the linens. Fresh cookies were delivered every evening as was ice. Coffee was replenished twice a day if needed. The hotel bar is upscale but comfortable and inviting. Guests are treated to live piano music (Elton John/Billie Joel style) every evening. The Wedgewood is in the heart of downtown and not on the water so the views are more reminiscent of city culture vs. the harbor. It is an easy walk every where. The only cab ride we took was from and back to the airport. Vancouver offers many, many great restaurants sand many of them are in the downtown area near this restaurant. There is shopping all around the hotel. LV, Gucci, Hermes or head in another direction for China town and street vendors. Review #31:The hotel rooms and decor are super combined with a great location (if there is such a thing in downtown Vancouver). The location being very close to downtown Vcr gets busy in the small lounge/breakfast room with non residents. In our view this hotel is extremly pretentious, A Maitre`d that floats around whilst the hard working breakfast staff cant cope and need help, food that is pretty to look at and very adventourous but falls well short of haute cuisine. Whilst the rooms are comfortable and spacious and the cookies at night are a nice touch, there the most expensive cookies you will ever buy. Overall a very expensive hotel. Review #32:My wife and I just returned from spending a long winter weekend at the Wedgewood between Jan 4 and 8, 2006. After reading the near flawless reviews of the Wedgewood, with great anticipation we booked a junior suite. We found slightly lower pricing on the hotel's web site and ended up paying about $185 USD on average per night. We were assigned a room on 11th floor and, although close to the elevator, we couldn't hear a thing. Overall, the staff is fantastic and the hotel is well appointed but for those expecting a 'W' type room experience, the Wedgewood might be a little disappointing. While comfortable, the room had very small TVs and the bathroom, considering we were in a junior suite, was surprisingly small. While I still would rate the experience close to a 9 out of 10, we frankly thought the hotel room would have slightly better amenities. Bottom line, the Wedgewood with its top notch customer service and location will not disappoint, however, this likely won't be the best hotel experience in a major international city. Review #33:We stayed here for 2 nights in May 2010 and were very impressed with the service from all staff and also for small touches such as free bottled water provided every day (3 bottles due to triple share), 3 sets of towels etc. Not always the case at other hotels. Location was excellent, close to all attractions and transport. I would recommend booking here if you manage to get one of their special rates. Also staff were extremely prompt in answering queries. I booked with the hotel directly and noticed that all my email queries and requests were answered promptly- takes a day at most for replies, which when you consider that I communicated from Aust was great service, Sheldon in particular was very pleasant. A great hotel, thoroughly recommended. Review #34:A very well run hotel without some of the annoying "cool" factor that affects some of the newer properties in the City. Highly professional and pleasant service. Rooms are a bit frayed at the seams - carpet, upholstery, furniture all a bit dated and ready for an upgrade, but the location is superb, and overall experience very satisfactory. Review #35:I recently stayed at the Wedgewood twice over a span of two weekends. For the first visit I was in a one bedroom suite... generously large by Vancouver standards... with an excellent hideabed mattress for my daughter. The second visit found me in a standard room... also spacious and refined. Breakfast at Bacchus was included both times, along with free valet parking. Location downtown was unbeatably close to Robson St shopping (1/2 block), restaurants like Coast and Joe Fortes (2 blocks), Vancouver Art Gallery (2 blocks), and Rogers Arena (7 blocks). I got a deal through the hotels website that was excellent. We look forward to coming back. Review #36:We were excited about staying at a hotel belonging to the Relais & Chateaux chain since we had not stayed at one in a while. Many aspects of the experience met our expectations. We had a nicely decorated small suite, and we found the valets who park the cars to be exceptionally friendly and helpful. We have folding bikes that we need to have stored, so we are more of a bother than most people to that part of the staff. But these men were full of good advice and cheerfully helped us whenever we asked. Also the restaurant is beautiful with a pleasant staff and good food. Our only real complaint was about the toilet in the bathroom of our suite. It leaked. Water formed around the hinges of the seat and on the floor of the room. We were told at the desk that condensation is a problem in Vancouver and that caused a problem with toilets. It is strange that we have stayed in Vancouver a half dozen times and never had this problem before. Housekeeping did put towels around the base of the toilet and controlled the situation somewhat. But I think that when the client is paying well in excess of $300 per night, the bathroom should function correctly. They did half heartedly offer to move our room, but indicated that all of the toilets had this problem, some less than others. Because of this problem, we would not stay at this hotel again.l Review #37:My husband and I just returned from a stay at the Wedgewood for our honeymoon. They upgraded our room at no additional cost and gave a beautiful suite with an amazing bathroom and large balcony. Unfortunately, we were next to a couple of rooms being renovated and were awoken every morning (8 AM) to loud noises. However, it only mildly hampered our stay, as everything else was outstanding. Our first night there we ate at the hotel restaurant and were treated very well. They made us special vegetarian dishes that were definitely 5 star meals. We also received complimentary champagne and dessert once the pianist told them we were on our honeymoon! The room was luxurious and the entire staff was overwhelmingly helpful and friendly. I will definitely be staying there again the next time I'm in Vancouver. I'd recommend this to anyone who can afford a little pampering. Review #38:The Wedgewood was fantastic. My husband and I stayed during the weekend of the finale of the Celebration Of Light fireworks. The staff was amazing. Not only did they leave chocolates and wine in the room for us, the housekeeping staff was pleasant and well trained and the
