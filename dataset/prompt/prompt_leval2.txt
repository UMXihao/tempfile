Review #0:Just returned from a 4 night stay. Overall a very nice hotel in an upscale location. It's located at the top of via veneto which is lined with upscale restaurants and hotels. Easy walk to Berbirini metro stop and across the street from a bus stop. Double room was spacious and clean. Bathrooms were marble and clean. Breakfast had a very good variety of food. Staff were helpful. Didn't have a chance to check out the fitness facility. Only a couple negatives...desk chair was wobbly and nearly broken. Internet didn't work in my original room. Review #1:After having stayed at a sub-par hotel for 5 days (hotel delle nazione) we were ready for a nice hotel and the Marriott did not disappoint. They were wonderful and gave us a very nice upgrade overlooking the gardens. Because they are an international chain - the rooms are nice-sized (much bigger than the European standard) They really get it when it comes to customer service - we had an enjoyable stay. Review #2:We found the Rome Marriott Grand Hotel Flora to be nearly perfect for us. We spent our first night and our last five nights in Italy there. The lobby is spacious, bright and comfortable. The rooms are large by European standards and well maintained. The bathroom we had for the last five nights had both a shower and a bathtub. There is free internet in the room. On the first floor there are two computers available for 30 minutes at a time for free, together with a free printer. The first room we stayed in had a view of the Via Veneto. The second room had a view of the walls by Borghese Park. We found the staff to be first rate and very friendly. The concierges were very helpful. They made good suggestions about restaurants and places to visit. For example, the concierge told us about a concert featuring operatic arias that we were very pleased to have attended. Before we checked out, the bellhops were able to weigh our luggage, so that we can avoid problems at the airport. We ate breakfast once at the Marriott. Breakfast is served on the roof on the seventh floor. You have good views of the Vatican and large parts of Rome from the roof. The location is great. The hotel is next to the southern entrance to the Villa Borghese Park, which is a very nice place to walk, bike ride and just relax on a bench. It is also the home of Villa Borghese Gardens. The hotel is not a difficult walk to the central part of Rome. The bus lines are convenient and there is a cabstand right around the corner. There are several very good restaurants within a few blocks of the hotel. We were very pleased to have stayed at this hotel. Review #3:Although this hotel is bit pricier than others, it's truly an excellent choice if you are traveling with your kids. We recently traveled with our 15 & 11 yr. old kids. They were happy to get an "american" size room with a huge sitting area (presidential suite). The staff was incredibly helpful and professional. The location was ideal. We were close to the park and a beautiful part of Rome that was just a bit away from all the crazy traffic and all the overwhelming tour groups. I would certainly stay here again! ! Review #4:For starters, I was traveling for business but got a great rate of 269 Euros, breakfast not included. Positives: The staff is fantastic, very good customer service. Very friendly and five star quality. Location is very good...but not spectacular as everyone described. I think I would have preferred to be closer to the Trevi Fountain or The Spanish Steps. Negatives: I arrived late after traveling and ordered room service. 35 Euros (about $50 USD) for the smallest pizza, bottle of water and glass of red wine. Tiny. And not very good. Also, my room was TINY. My suitcase wouldn't even fit between the bed and the TV, I had to lift it over. Finally, the bedding and the shower are in serious need of an update. I can't believe they would have such outdated ammenities in a five star hotel. Luckily, I didn't really pay five star price...because it wouldn't have been worth it. However, for what I paid it was very comfortable and clean, in a fine location and the staff was extremely friendly. If you have a choice, The Westin is right up the street and looks better. Review #5:Stayed here for 3 days in August. Very nice hotel with all the conveniences of American hotels. The room was a bit on the small side but very nice. Short walk to the Spanish steps and lot's of good restraunt choices near by. Would definitely saty here again. Review #6:It's what you should expect in Rome...expensive hotels...small rooms. But it was clean, quiet (asked for an interior room away from the street), and comfortable. Front desk staff was helpful and accommodating. Free internet was nice. Nice location - across from restaurants, shopping, metro station; pleasant walk to Spanish Steps - 10 mins or so Would go back. Review #7:Good location - steps away from Villa Borghese, major Piazzas, walking distance to Spanish Steps, Harry's Bar, and Trevi Fountain. The room and the bathroom were tiny in comparson to the other hotels. A bonus is that they give you free internet access - that's unheard of at most hotels in Europe. This hotel is on Via Venetto which is home to most of the 5 star hotels in Rome. I would stay here again. Review #8:I enjoyed our stay, as we stayed three nights in two rooms. (Kids in one, adults in others). The rooms are small by American standards, so there is no way to put four in a room. You'll need to splurge a bit or use points. I enjoyed the hotel, but I think the Via Veneto is past its heyday. As we strolled through Rome, I was wishing we would have stayed a in a little more "authentic" neighborhood, and the Via Veneto is crammed with hotel names you can see anywhere. We walked to the Spanish Steps and Trevi fountain without issue, but only took the subway to the Coliseum. We had a taxi to the Vatican. The breakfast on the rooftop is a bit oversold. We did it one morning, and found the views to be great, but the food was about what you would find in the average US concierge floor, and the prices were pretty steep. Better values can be had all over Rome, and we found them close to the hotel with better food. Service was up to Marriott standards, as was the housekeeping. I know there are those to list how to "walk" from teh train station, but don't consider it if you are traveling with kids or carrying luggage....it is a haul. I think 10 Euros got four of us to the hotel in 6-7 minutes, and it was money well spent! Not a bad hotel at all, and would go back if I were staying with points! Review #9:Perfect location for our business travel group. Marriott Grand Flora met our expectations in all categories: Close proximity to the airport (40 Euro or less by Taxi), easy walking distance to the center of Rome via Metro tunnel (across the street), comfortable rooms, large bed, stylish rooms with good working area. Breakfast buffet included and a reasonable internet fee (9 Euro for 7 days). Professional staff and helpful Concierge. Rates are competitive and Marriott has the edge with this hotel. Our next hotel reservation will be at the Grand Flora on our return trip. Review #10:This hotel's location is excellent for walking to most of the sites in town. Those that are not in walking distance can be reached by the subway, which can be accessed across the street. (The entrance tunnel to the subway is very long, maybe a block!) For Americans, keep in mind that this hotel is much more European than many Marriotts, especially when it comes to breakfast. Everything about my stay perfect. Review #11:We stayed at the Grand Flora in June 2007, using a Marriott European sampler. Hard to get nights at this property for points, so we lucked out (I am platinum, not sure if that helps). Staff was very friendly and helpful, and while (as other have said) the breakfast was not anything to write home about, it was free and afforded spectacular views of the city - a wonderful way to start your day in Rome. The location was great, as Rome is a very "walk-able" city. The rooms are a bit tired and warn and the beds are hard, but the bath was lovely, and the view of the Villa Borghese (park) from the window alcove was stunning. Loved the huge windows and the fact that you could throw them open and sit on the wide stone edging outside of the window. We were on the second floor and did not hear any street noise when the windows were closed. Note: part of the Via Venetto was closed during our first 2 days due to Bush's state visit, so it was even quite when the windows were open! Not sure if I would pay $500 a night, but I certainly feel I made good use of my Marriott points! Review #12:The Marriott Gran Flora is a wonderful hotel. The rooms, staff and food are excellent. Breakfast is served on the top floor of the hotel. You may eat outside with outstanding views of the city or inside. The breakfast is the most generous in regard to selection and fine quality. Each day for no charge you may have a picnic lunch to take if you wish. The Gran Flora located on Via Venuto is surrounded by excellent restaurants-Harry' Bar and Grille and many others. You can easily walk to the Spanish Steps and if you are in good shape Trevi Fountain. Other sites are a short taxi ride away. Review #13:We had not planned to go to this hotel so we did not have any expectations. All in all it was a very nice and pleasant experience. Rumors about arrogant Romans offering poor service do not emerge from this hotel. The staff is very professional, smiling and always helpful. We had just spent a terrible night at a dreadful hotel in Fiuggi south west of Rome, and coming to the Marriott Grand Flora was such a relief. Itl was the exact opposite of the other hotel in Fuiggi (Hotel Sliva Splendid). Maybe we were easy to please, but we really enjoyed everything about this hotel (did miss free internet access in the room though). The loacation is great â€“ on Via Veneto, close to the Villa Borghese garden and the Spanish Steps. A nice quiet corner compared to the crowded streets close to the Trevi Fountain, Piazza Navona, Termini etc. Conclusion: Highly reccommend. Review #14:Stayed here two nights at a rate of about 350 EU a night in July. While we had stayed at cheaper properties around rome (120-150 EU nights) I am pretty loyal to Marriott and decided to check this one out. Unlike the last review, I found the staff to be pretty nice and very friendly. I'm only in my 20's and don't dress like the typical high class person if you will (shorts and sandals for me all day) yet they were very friendly and outgoing. First night the room service brought a free bottle of wine for us (nice little touch), Unlimited internet and breakfast on the roof-top were also included (i'm not sure if this was all because I'm a 'gold' member with them or not). Would I stay here again, probably not for the price. Was just as happy if not happier with a couple of hotels in rome we stayed at that were 120-150 EU a night. But the flora was nice I'll give it that, but not any nicer than the average Marriott property in the states i thought Review #15:My husband and I spent a month traveling around Italy for our honeymoon and stayed in Rome for one week at the end of the trip. Rome was our last stop and we were more than pleased with the Grand Flora. It is located on a very prestigious street with many other 5-star hotels. We thought the Grand Flora was located in a perfect spot just across from the Borghese Park and within walking distance to most everything. It is a cab ride to the Ancient City and Vatican but neither were very pricey (less than 10 euros). We were upgraded to a VERY large room (the size of some peoples homes) with a beautiful view of the Borghese Park and St. Peter's Dome. They serve breakfast every morning on their rooftop with sweeping views of Rome. The breakfast was amazing, they had the largest spread of any hotel we stayed at while on the trip. It was delicious with spectacular views. We had turndown service every night with some great chocolates as well. They do offer free internet which was nice so we could catch up on the news and stay in touch with family. The staff was very helpful (espcially the bell men). Review #16:I stayed at the Marriott Grand Hotel Flora for a company business meeting. We were a group of 12 people and we also used the hotels meeting facilities. The room was well equipped and comfortable, including free internet, which was very important to me. The meeting room was well prepared including the proper seating arrangement, and the relevant audio visual equipment. Besides the business activities, the hotel is very well located at the top of Via Veneto, and has a rooftop terrance on the seventh floor with an amazing view of the entire city. Review #17:This hotel is located on Via Veneto in a very upscale neighborhood. It took about 20-25 minutes to walk to Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain, and Pantheon area. The cab ride to Colosseum was 5 euro. We took the Metro to the Vatican area and the ride costs 1 euro, or you can buy a one-day pass for 4 euro good for subway as well as buses. Front reception is professional and friendly. Our request for early check-in was accommodated. FREE INTERNET FOR 7 DAYS! (we did not get free Internet anywhere else on this trip to Italy). Room is lovely and quiet. The shower does not flood the bathroom, which is rare in Italian hotels. Lovely hotel. I would definitely stay there again. Review #18:If you want true 5 star service and standards you are used to in Asia.....don't go to Rome. This hotel is simply the best quality and overall value for Rome. I have stayed all over the Via Vittorio Veneto (think the set of La Dolce Vita) and the Marriott wins everytime. First, realize that all of the top Italian hotels put all their money into the lobby...they all look great from the outside. The rooms are often a much different story. Second...the is the Manhattan of Rome...so unless you are willing to spend $3000 a night for a room, you will get a 4 and even a 3 star experience in most of these tired old properties even when you spend $400+ a night. But remember...it is Roma!! Dont spend time in your room!!! Explore and eat and stay out late. Here is one downside of this (and most high end) Marriotts....at peak season they are full of loud, obnoxious, large American housewives with 2+ iPhone disinterested teenagers in tow and a beaten down corporate exec husband who paid for the entire trip with frequent flyer miles and then Marriott miles. They moan and groan and complain about EVERYTHING and this is their "payback" for a year of being abandoned by their world trotting hard working husbands -- who are all platinum elite status. They want everything free and they are highly resentful that their spouse gets to escape from the soccer mom life all year for places like Rome, Bangkok, Sydney, etc...surrounded by fun, young, hot women. So....leave your fat wife at home....bring a smile, shoulder shrug and love of all things Italian and Rome and this Marriott will be the BEST decision you could make. Old but spotless clean with VERY good staff who are exceptionally helpful....even to loud complaining spouses. Review #19:My wife and I stayed the Marriott Grand Flora for our Honeymoon. The service was fantastic and everyone spoke English which was a huge help for us. We told the front desk that it was our honeymoon and they upgraded us to a Jr. suite and then sent a bottle of Champaign to our room. Alitalia lost our luggage and the concierge did a great job talking to the airline to help us get out luggage back. The room was a good size with a comfortable bed, and all the amenities you would expect form a Marriott. Overall we were very pleased with our stay. Review #20:We are just concluding a week in Rome with our 2 adult daughters. Each morning we would meet for a fantastic buffet breakfast on the 7th floor. The hotel is at the top of Via Vittorio Veneto - just below Borhgese Gardens so you take in a perfect view of Rome from the huge expanse of windows while dining. The staff is warm and very helpful but other than suggestions for dining, your access to Rome needs no assist! The taxi stand is a couple of blocks down the hill, and the A Metro Barbarini stop a couple of blocks further. We walked or rode all over Rome and we always came home to a beautiful and tranquil room overlooking Via Veneto. For those who are light sleepers, we live suburban quiet lives and noise was never an issue - just Roman background music. The restaurant, The Cabiria,and the bar are also of excellent quality and service. Review #21:Me and my husband stayed at the hotel for 4 nights abd 5 days! we absolutely loved our warm stay. The staff was kind, warm and hospitable. We loved the rooms! they were typical english rooms. It was our honeymoon so, we loved the cosy feel of the place. We had a great time. The complimentary breakfast was also well arranged and delicious. Review #22:This is a fairly expensive hotel in the heart of Rome and has everything you would expect from a luxury hotel. The staff are great, the decor is really nice and looks clean and new. The location is perfect, with lots of shops and restaurants nearby, within walking distance of all the major sights and right next to a large park. My king size room was a good size. Some colleagues mentioned that their single rooms seemed a bit small but they admitted that they were very comfortable. Breakfast is a highlight with a fantastic view of the city from the 7th floor terrace. At â‚¬30 breakfast is a bit pricey. Book direct with the hotel and try to negotiate a price that includes breakfast then you won't have to worry about it. Review #23:This Marriott was wonderful. Everything from the location, the hotel staff, the free internet, the cleanliness, and the roof top breakfest. The hotel is within walking distance for everything especially the spanish step and the trevi fountain. As a Gold member I would recommend this hotel. The only recomendation would be to upgrade the TV's and add CNN as one of their channel selections. Review #24:Our stay was one night on September 27 and three nights Oct 2-4 using Marriott points. We have no complaints although we probably would not have paid the going rate if we did not have points. Our one night only stay was in a slightly better room with a very comfortable bed and luxury linens. The three night stay at the end of our trip to Italy, had a harder bed and standard hotel bedding, so I think there are difference in the rooms withinin the same category. The breakfast on the terrace every day was great - eveything you could want - and the view was beautiful! The front desk staff was helpful. They were very professional if not overly friendly. The hotel is very near the Borghese gardens which we visited twice. We walked to the Trevi fountain every day while at the hotel and to the Spanish steps. We also walked from the Pantheon, the Vatican and the Forum - although those walks were longer than many would consider walking distance. Review #25:We stayed here using Marriott points for our last night in Rome. We found the location to be very convenient. The room was spacious, clean and had that old world charm. The breakfast buffet was fabulous. The dining room is on the top floor overlooking all of Rome. It was absolutely beautiful. And the food was great too :) We would stay here again if we get the chance! Review #26:went to rome with my husband for 5 nights. the hotel was lovely even though it was expensive. there wasnt any tea and coffee making facilities which i found unusual. the girl at reception was very helpful and gave us a map and circled the best shopping area lol. would definately go back. Review #27:I found this hotel on trip advisor. I was originally scheduled to stay at another well know hotel that the reviews were not so good so I changed to this property. I loved my room. Reception and check in were excellent. In room dinning and the Cabiria Restaurant had great food and service. All good! Review #28:We spent three great nights at the Grand Flora. To start with, the location was superb. We saw every typical tourist sight there is, and never took a cab. With that said, the hotel is not in too busy an area. The rooms are spacious by European standards, kept very clean and are maintained well. The staff was professional and helpful. The management of this hotel is firt class. Bottom line - stay here. Review #29:The Marriott Grand Flora in Rome is a beautiful hotel in a great location in Rome. The hotel staff was great! Hotel restaurant was very nice, but so many other fantastic restaurants in the area. I highly recommend this property if you're staying in Rome. Review #30:The hotel is attractive and conveniently located, but nearby restaurants are pricey. We were fortunate to stay for free using Marriott points. Perhaps that is why they gave us a very small room. The bathroom was small too. Linens were not luxurious. They do not have king size beds and the 2 beds kept sliding apart. They did let us check email free on their computers. The doormen and the concierge were barely helpful. Disappointing service. If we had to pay, we'd check out the Westin. Review #31:We used points for 2 rooms at the Marriott Grand Flora for 4 nights in June. Check-in was easy and our rooms were very clean and comfortable with all marble bathrooms. Breakfast on the roof terrace overlooking the city was exceptionally beautiful, although upon arriving each morning it was difficult to find a clean table to sit down to. We found the location to be very good as we walked to sites with the exception of the Vatican which was a 10 euro cab ride. We should have allowed more time in Rome, although no matter how long of a stay there would still be more to see. Review #32:My wife and I spent 3 night at Grand Flora at the head of Via Veneto and thoroughly enjoyed it. The location was in an exciting part of town with many shops, restaurants and points of interest within walking distance. The hotel was very nicely appointed and was very clean throughout. Our room was a little dated but nice sized, clean, comfortable and most importantly, quiet. Among the many things we liked, the two that stood out were the staff and the rooftop restaurant. The staff couldn't do enough for us. Every member (and there were MANY) seemed to have been selected for personality and poise. If the young lady who spent 20 minutes helping me get my cell phone going is reading, again I say gracie mille! Along the same lines, a wonderful complimentary breakfast was served in a rooftop restaurant that was bright, well appointed and had the most sumtuous assortments of foods one could imagine. It also has an outdoor patio that looks West and North with views of the city, the beautiful Borgese gardens and park. Again, the entire staff in the restaurant was very anxious to help in any way that they could. While there are less expensive addresses and hotels in which to stay in Rome, I would definetly recommend the Grand Flora for a full, enriching experience. Review #33:This wasn't the nicest Marriot I've ever stayed in, but it definitely was a nice hotel. The room was a bit small, but I suppose that is Europe. The one big complaint I had about the room was that the two double beds we had were pushed together (which is common in Europe). I wouldn't mind in a three star hotel, but in a four or five star hotel, I expect enough space in the room to have the bed's spaced apart. The bathroom was very nice and was tastefully done. One huge thing that I like a lot was free high-speed internet. Europe, as a whole, just does not offer free internet in most hotels, regardless of class. That is why I was pleasantly surprised to have free internet access in the room. Did not eat in the hotel at all. When I am sight-seeing or seeing a new city for pleasure, I think the worst possible thing to do is eat in the hotel unless the dining experience at a hotel warrants a visit in itself. Overall, I liked the hotel. Very nice, elegant neighborhood and the hotel staff was very friendly. Review #34:From the moment you arrive at the Grand Flora Hotel on Via Veneto, you know that you are at one of Marriott's premier hotels. The doormen are so polite and accommodating. You enter an elegant hotel, beautifully decorated with a lovely marble staircase. We traveled with our two teenage sons, and we had two Superior rooms on the second floor. We only used the stairs which were so convenient. The rooms were of a nice size, the beds were very comfortable, and the bathrooms, while not very large, were of beautiful marble and were very clean. The breakfast buffet and the view from the rooftop was incredible! We were spoiled by the wonderful selection of eggs, meats, cheeses, pastries and more. You can walk to the Spanish Steps. I did walk to Piazza Navona, but it was a very long walk. To get to the Vatican, take a cab or walk down Via Veneto to the Barberini Station to take the train to the Vatican/St. Peter's Square. Via Veneto remains a beautiful avenue to stay on, and should we return to Rome, we would return to the Grand Flora Hotel. Review #35:Just amazing....top to bottom, gorgeous hotel, security at night. Delicious breakfast on the roof in the AM. Its Europe, so the rooms are small. Dont expect to stay in a large suite it may be a Marriot, but its still in Rome. Small Rooms VERY clean though. Gorgeous bathrooms. Located on Via Venetto which is very popular with the nicer hotels and restaurants. Although not my favorite restaurants on the strip. Very commercial. Another great thing about this Hotel is it is located across from Villa Borghese which I a beautiful Park, if you get a decent room, you may have an amazing view. Review #36:We stayed two nights. The hotel is a beautiful old hotel. Similar to those in San Francisco or Washington DC. Beautifully appointed, clean and with a great view of the area. The elevator is very small. The staff were most accommodating and checked us in early and promptly. The internet and Wifi service was great. Breakfast was included, but the American version is not good. Eggs were runny and most of the food was cold. The European breakfast was very good. The dinning terrace was closed when we were there. Review #37:We stayed there on the last leg of our 18 day vacations through italy. The hotel was nice, the breakfast was excellent, the service was good. We feel the it was over priced for what we got compared to other places. I would stay again if the price was right we paid a 5 star price and got a 3 1/2 star experience. Review #38:This was our first trip to Rome and we wanted to stay someplace nice. Marriott Grand Flora is very nice. We stayed using points and were upgraded to a Jr. Suite - very, very nice. Hotel is in great upscale location. Plenty to do within walking distance. Good selection of restaurants in area. Metro station not too far. The Jr. Suite was a good size bedroom and comfortable living/sitting room. Roof restaurant for breakfast was closed, but looked like a great place to start the day. You can see the Vatican from the roof. Doorman was very helpful with directions, taxis, etc. Internet service provided free. Review #39:We stayed at the Marriott Flora for 4 days at the beginning of our trip to Italy and 2 days at the end of our 3 week vacation. The hotel is perfectly located on the beautiful Via Venetto street where you can eat, shop and or just take a nice walk. The hotel is a 5 minute walk to the Spanish Steps, and from there a few minutes more walk to the shopping street of Via Del Corso and sites to see such as the Trevi Fountain, Pantheon and other spectacular churches. Its also at the entrance of the a park called Villa Borghese. We rented bikes for a couple of Euros and had a great morning ride with my wife and 12yr daughter. Service was 5*... the hotel took great care of to ensure we has a great stay, from the check-in staff to the restaurant staff (we had breakfast included). We needed a roll-in bed for my daugther which i forgot to mention on the reservation and they set it up within minutes of check-in apologizing to me - for my mistake! The roof-top restaurant is spectacular for breakfast. Great views of the Vatican and the park. Would definitely stay here again. Review #40:Very nice location; the Via Veneto is the Roman equivalent of Rodeo Drive in Hollywood, or the Champs Elysee in Paris. Very expensive shops in the area. It's not in the center of all the touristic sites, but not too dreadfully far from a metro station either through which you can access the rest of Rome. The rooms are rather small, but nicely decorated. The bed was fairly comfortable. The staff was very friendly and attentive to requests. The music in the bar was rather loud, which made conversation somewhat difficult. Review #41:We stayed for a long weekend here whilest my wife was in Italy for business outside the city. The reception was great we felt relly welcome. Staff very helpfull and friendly. The room was nice, overlooking the via vento and not noisy. The bathroom was very nice. room was not big but very comfortable. Breakfast was great, good food while overlooking the city from the roofterras. good capucinos. Bar was very welcoming with good service also while sitting outside late in the evening. No complains here! Wwe while return for sure when my wife has to to be in Italy again for work. Review #42:My wife and I stayed here using points for 5 nights and it was a great experience. Unlike other hotels when you stay with points, the staff was very friendly and even gave us a room upgrade. The room was clean and quiet. The breakfast was very good each morning with a great view from the roof. The location is great as it is fairly close to the Spanish Steps metro stop and there a number of bus stops just outside the hotel that can get you pretty much anywhere. Review #43:Stayed here in Feb. 2008. The rooms are not a typical Marriott room. They are worn but still nice. The staff was helpful. Great location. It was in walking distance of all of the main sites. Lobby was nice. Hotel bar was great and the bartender was fantastic. We had the free breakfast buffet. I would not pay for it but since it was free we ate at it a couple times during our stay. Review #44:Earlier this month, my husband and I were fortunate enough to stay at this lovely hotel for 5 nights. We were thrilled with its location, right on the Via Veneto, inside the old wall, with many dining options in the evenings. We had a fantastic suite, with a balcony overlooking the city and the Via Veneto. This is an old hotel, that is in perfect condition. Rooms and public areas are immaculate. The staff is very helpful and professional. We really enjoyed the excellent breakfast every morning, that was made especially nice, by being able to eat outside, and enjoy the views. The breakfast staff was particularly good. This is a great hotel, in a wonderful location. Review #45:We stayed for a week at the Flora. The location is terrific. You can walk to a lot of the attractions. (albeit a long walk). Right outside the hotel is a portal for the 1800 year old Aurelian Wall. Across the street is the Villa Borghese. The staff throught the hotel provided excellent and friendly service. There are tons of sidewalk restaurants in the area. One tip - Across the street you will find an escalator down to an underground level. Actually, it is two escalators. If you take that and walk a couple of hundred yards, you will find a complete supermarket underground. This is a great place to get some snacks , water and even a bottle of vino for your room. We found the rooms to be decent. The bathroom was a bit small in our first room but part of that is due to the bidet. Breakfast on the rooftop is a great experience. You can see the vatican and other landmarks (bring binoculars if you can) When we were leaving, our flight had to return for an emergency landing due to a cracked windshield. The airline tried to put us up in what they claimed was a four star hotel in Ostia. that place was a dump. We called the Flora and they confirmed they had a room available. Unfortunately, the limo service they use didn't have any available cars but we were able to find a limo on our own. Summary. If we go back to Rome, we will most likely make the Flora our first choice. Review #46:Even by European standards this hotel is not a 5 star. Yes, if you want a big room on the most expensive street in Rome, then book here. The rooms and bedding are outdated and old. The beds were uncomfortable, no covers, and the bathroom was small (not unexpected in
