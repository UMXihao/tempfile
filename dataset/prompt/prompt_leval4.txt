Review #0:We recently had to spend a night in Vancouver because of an early flight out of YVR. We found that it was cheaper staying in downtown Vancouver at a quality hotel than by the airport. Because the new Canada Line runs from downtown to the airport in less than 30 minutes for only $2.50 after 6 and weekends, it's actually easier than waiting for airport hotel shuttles. We paid $70 a night on Priceline for the Renaissance and was pleasantly surprised by the experience. We were there during the last weekend of the Paralympics and yet check-in was quick and the room assigned was roomy and comfortable. Unfortunately, I am a light sleeper and the first room was on a floor with noisy young people running between rooms. However, we quickly got another room without any argument and were told that if we were not happy with it, they would find us a room that would make us happy. It turns out that the second room was behind the elevator shaft so.....we were cheerfully given a third room. Luckily, the third room was quiet and comfortable. Five stars for the front-desk's cheerful and "make-right" attitude. Other so-called 4 star hotels should learn from this attitude. Review #1:We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights in a 17th-floor room facing the harbour. Check-in was quick and efficient, the room well maintained and clean. Our request for foam pillows was promptly fulfilled. As mentioned in other reviews, there is construction in front of the hotel, and seaplanes start and land frequently after 7:30am on weekdays. While the extra windows on the balcony do a pretty good job of minimizing the noise I would recommend bringing earplugs if you are a light sleeper and if you are planning to sleep in. Once you get up, a terrific breakfast buffet awaits you. We managed to get an excellent rate and really enjoyed our stay. Review #2:The hotel offers beautiful views of the waterfront and the rooms are spacious and relatively modern. I found the staff to be less than friendly and not very accomodating, particluarly the staff in the restaurant. If traveling for business, this hotel is not a great option. Lack of a business center is problematic if you need to print anything. Hotel turned former business center into a small shop leaving guests forced to share two computers and one printer located in the lobby - which means you are often waiting on someone to finish checking email. Review #3:My wife and I stayed here for a quick weekend getaway. Considering the great deal we got through Priceline, the hotel was excellent. We arrived three hours early, and when I asked them if they could check our baggage in so we could tour around Vancouver, they did us one better and got us room without delay. The common areas were very clean and well-appointed. Where the hotel loses clout with me is in the size of the rooms. For a four-star, it seemed the rooms were very small, and the bathroom was downright claustrophobic. The bed was very comfortable, though, and television programming was plentiful (which was nice when we were taking a break from walking around town). In-room coffee was very good. If you want Internet, it is nearly $16 CAD per day! Which was tough, because I had to do some work. To summarize, though, the hotel was excellent for the Priceline bid we put in. I would have been less thrilled if we paid the off-the-rack rate of $170-200, given how small the rooms are. Review #4:The rooms are good, the service is good, and the prices are reasonable. I decided to choose this hotel following previous reviews on trip advisor, and I wasn't disappointed. I would recommend this hotel to my friends. Vancouver is a really nice city, and this hotel is pretty well located. Review #5:I've stayed at this hotel twice. First time I had a city view, which was nice. Second time I had a harborview. Nice to look out and see the seaplanes land. With the construction across the street, the water view is partially blocked. Both rooms have great beds and nice linens. Wallpaper is an odd blue star patern, but oh well. None of the interior seemed to be the same (wallpaper, chairs, curtains, etc but the bedding was the simple white). Didn't eat at the hotel. Pool area is nice. I would stay there again. Review #6:My husband and I booked this through priceline, thinking we'd be staying at a four star hotel. We were certainly impressed with the name, delighted by the deal and looked forward to the location. Upon arrival, the lobby was chaos with luggage strewn everywhere for a Coors Light/Maxim event...it felt like a frat house. Reception was chilly and the only time the desk clerk smiled was when she offered us a room with a water view for an extra $30 per night. Seriously? We went to our room to freshen up and were nonplussed. It was fine, but certainly not four star. The chaise lounge was stained, the desk was dusty and the bathroom was cramped at best. We took off to see the sights and returned later that evening to get ready for bed. Well...we didn't notice this during daylight hours, but upon closing our room door and dimming the lights, we noticed that we could see clearly into the hallway via spaces between the door and doorjamb. Not just light, but actual people passing by! On all four sides! If that wasn't enough, this also allowed quite a bit of sound to travel through to our room, and we heard every step, cough, door click, etc. all night long. We were SO disappointed! Good thing it was only one night! Review #7:Booked a great rate through one of the bidding services. When we arrived, they initially gave us a room directly above a band playing for a special event, right next to the swimming pool entrance - however, when we complained, we were promptly given a room higher up. Excellent attitude by the staff, good amenities (pool, workout facility, restaurant, and parking on the premises), and a clean room all added up to a great stay. Could walk to Robson Street. Wish they had a fan in the bathroom. Review #8:We arrived at 8am, following an early morning departure from an Alaskan cruise, given a warm welcome by the receptionist and advised our room was ready. Great to be able to relax for a couple of hours before exploring Vancouver. All the staff very helpful and efficient. An excellent location for downtown Vancouver and the harbour. Excellent stay. Review #9:The view from our room in the Renaissance overlooked Coal Harbor and Stanley Park. We enjoyed watching the seaplanes take off and the various water traffic. Far off we could see the mountains. Our room had the classic Renaissance features and quality. The breakfast was worth getting up early for. Wished we could have stayed longer. Review #10:Very nice view from our hotel room afforded us the colors of sunrise set against the majesty of a mountain range to and the goings on of a bustling sailplane business. We are Marriott concierge members so were able to avail ourselves of the 19th floor Concierge Lounge. Very nice hosts up there and when we did dine at the main level buffet it was also pleasant. Room is somewhat dated, but very clean and comfortable. We really enjoyed the complimentary jogging maps -a nice touch. Review #11:Very pleasant and helpful check-in. We had the room via Priceline but there were no knowing looks or comments we sometimes get when we have booked using the P/Line bidding system. We had a beautiful 16th floor room facing the front of the hotel. Window opened okay and there was very little noise from the street. Well appointed room, complete with safe. One thing we did notice was that there was only one bath/handtowel/facecloth per person. Not a big deal as I am sure we could have had extra if we had asked for them and they were very good quality anyway. Bed very comfortable. Room very quiet even though it was an adjoining room and one of the nights there were people in the other room but hardly noticeable. Just as we got to the room there was an emergency announcement over intercom made by the duty Manager advising us not to use elevators and that we would be advised accordingly. Little nerve racking as we were up on the 16th floor and then the emergency vehicles arrived. However, Duty Manager made at least two more announcements keeping us apprised which was reassuring. It was a false alarm but all the staff we very reassuring and helpful. Hotel itself is beautiful very spacey, clean and all staff we encountered were friendly and helpful. Great deal for drinking at the hotel itself as there is a different beer and wine special of $5 each every day. Also, free computer use is available in the lobby. Location was perfect, especially if you don't have your own transport. Hotel is within walking distance to buses, cafés, restaurants and all the local attractions. We even walked to Granville Island and though it is a good walk we enjoyed it. Review #12:The hotel is well located close to the harbour, shopping on Robson street and walking distance to Stanley Park. When we checked in we inquired about the fitness facilities as advertised on the web site. We were informed that they were closed for renovation but we could use the facilities at the Marriott accross the street. Had we known this in advance we would have booked our room at the Marriott. Our room was recently renovated, spacious and with a city view. We found the rate for parking to be a little pricey at $21 per day. We went down for breakfast and were seated quickly but ignored for almost ten minutes without being offered coffee. The breakfast buffet had limited selection and was overpriced. When I asked for a newspaper they informed I would have to go accross the street to get one at the gift shop in the Marriott. There are lots of choices of hotels in this price range in this area of Vancouver. I would not stay here again. Review #13:One night stay due to the Marriott Pinnacle being fully booked for my last day in Vancouver. Just across the street, so I was at the front desk in seconds. Efficient check in and got my room immediately despite being early, nice room with view of sea. Slightly tired decor, but clean and comfortable. Seems to be more of a tourist hotel than the Pinnacle, lots of coaches so if you are unlucky it could be a long wait to check in. Room rate was very high for the quality of accommodation on offer. But no real complaints. Review #14:Good Location if traveling for business or you have a car! Got this hotel thru a discount travel company and paid $65.00 american a night. Excellent deal at this price. We had a terrific view from the 16th floor. Unfortunetly the view is going to be partly blocked with yet another "Glass tower" going in. The room was spacious and clean. No tub in our room. Bed was really hard and needed 4 extra pillows. The TV was not working properly. room felt sort of dated in interior. Hotel itself was very clean and so were the amenities. Front Desk staff very nice. Very unsatisfied with long distance calls to USA. Was told one rate and got billed $$$. check out staff, smiled and said thats the rate. Unacceptable. Woould stay here again in the future. -) Happy New Year! Review #15:This was my first trip to Vancouver and our stay at the Renaissance was the highlight of a wonderful trip. THe view of the harbor was to die for!!! It was heavenly waking up to such an amazing view of the water and turning in with a lovely view of the sparkling city across the way. Each day we would return to the hotel after hours of sight seeing and the view was so breathtaking I think would have been perfectly content watching the planes land/take off from the water all day long. Besides the view, the bed was absolutely divine. We were in Vancouver in September and it was slightly chilly but the heated floors of the bathroom was a great touch. There is nothing I would change about this hotel or trip. THe staff was very polite and helpful, esp in organizing one of our excursions to Victoria Island. We definitely stay here again. Review #16:I must start out by saying that the staff at this hotel is awesome! The hotel itself is VERY tired and the guest rooms and hallways need desperately to be updated. The very obviously updated lobby and bar area is beautiful. There were long black hairs stuck to the ceiling in the bathroom that remained my entire 6 night stay - and what appeared to be a pubic hair on the side of the bath tub when we checked in (which I removed myself.....ewww) The food in the lounge is pretty good and again, the service outstanding. would not go back to this hotel. Review #17:I booked this hotel through Priceline for $64 a night. What a great deal! The hotel appears to be recently renovated and everything worked out well. I saw that some people were complaining about the cost of parking or the internet, but if they had a clue about anything, they would know that all of the comparable hotels in Vancouver charge the same prices. (Hyatt, Delta, Marriott, Sheraton) and I have stayed at all of them. This hotel is right there in the same class. My complaint would be that the hot tub is tiny, there was a family in there so we went back to our room watched a movie instead. The gym was big though. Also there was an alarm that went off in one of the rooms for 45mins, we called down and someone came up to switch it off within 5minutes. Review #18:It is a good thing I booked this hotel through priceline at a discounted rate, the quality and service we received for this hotel was not even on par with a two star hotel. Even with the discount in mind, for what we paid I was still quite disappointed. First of all - this was a weekend girls getaway for two working professional women who wanted to visit the city and pamper ourselves (at least a little bit.) I saw on the website that this property had a pool and jacuzzi open 24 hours as well as a sauna. The Jacuzzi was closed for cleaning, and then was out of order for the entire weekend. We were ok with this as we thought to just use the sauna - There is none! The website falsely advertises this feature (amongst others). I was told by a hotel staff who was laughing that it was "not replaced when the hotel was renovated"..IN 2008!!!!! I don't think it takes 2+ years to change details on the website. There were blood stains on my sheet and the balcony was filthy. I met the housekeeper of our floor and she was so lovely and sweet, the attention to detail of these issues was likely an oversight as the result of being allotted to many rooms to clean. The decor is best described as "confused". It is modern minimalism meets country western/Mediterranean. The hotel doorman was very gracious, the beds were ok and the location was near a skytrain station. These are only the good qualities this hotel has to offer. Like I said. Stay at a two star hotel and save your pennies. Why exactly is this hotel considered a four star luxury hotel anyways? They even charge for internet. Review #19:Stayed here on Dec 3, 2008. This is a nice Renaissance with harbor views. I booked a harbor view room and was given a lovely corner room on trhe 8th floor. While the hotel is not right on the water (there are a few condo buildings closer to the water) I was still able to have a nice view. The workout room was under repair during my stay, but they let guests use the Marriot workout room which is across the street. I can also see why this hotel is popular with cruises since the location is close to the terminal. I didn't eat on site, but do recommend Joe Fortes Seafood and Chop House. Vancouver is beautiful and I can't wait to return in January for my next business trip. Review #20:We had a great harbor view room during our short stay in Vancouver. It was within walking distance of downtown. PROS: 1. Wonderful view with early check in 2. Ease of navigating the city, dinner reservations 3. The bellman rapid and courteous service 4. The service from the waiter for the wonderful breakfast buffet. CONS: None Review #21:First, the view was extraordinary. There is construction blocking part of the view, but staying in one of the western-most rooms still gives you a terrific field of view. Rooms -41 and -39 are in the western corner. Enhancing the view, is the fact that there is an enclosed balcony with a couple chairs. You can even open the window and get fresh air. Very nice. Downtown location is great. It's a nice part of town and it's not too far to walk to Robson street, Stanley Park, or along the waterfront. Not too many restaurants in the immediate area, so plan on going somewhere else if you want to eat other than in the hotel. There are nice ammenities to the room, such as the heated bathroom tiles and very comfortable beds. However, the decor is aging somewhat and I expected something fresher. It didn't take away too much from the week-long experience, but kept it from being an excellent room. The new construction does block the Canada Day fireworks completely, which are a little further up Coal Harbour. (Take note for 2008!) Ultimately, I would stay here again. I would hope that the rooms are rennovated before my next visit, but it wouldn't stop me. Review #22:My first visit to Vancouver, British Columbia was exceptional. Upon entering the hotel, we were treated with personalized courtesy from the bell captain to the lobby staff. The front desk lady greeted us by name and went out of her way to accommodate our room preference. The harbour views were breathtaking and exciting. Even though, there was constuction taking place near the harbour it was negligible to the serene water views we experienced. We stayed on the 10th floor on the right side facing the water. The view of the harbour is better toward the right side. The construction is necessary so that city of Vancouver can prepare for the 2010 Winter Olympics. Yes, we definitely would stay here on a return trip! Review #23:Upon arriving in Vancouver, one day prior to our cruise departure, it was apparent that the hotel we had booked was not in a good part of town. Desperation set in and we hopped in a cab and headed back downtown to the Renaissance Vancouver Harbourside Hotel. Upon arriving, a young but very Professional and understanding Miss Amanda Bye listened to our plight and got us into an amazing room at a last minute special rate. She was extremely helpful and kind and in a world of not so great customer service, Miss Bye exceeding all of our expectations and turned a very bad first night in Vancouver into a very good one! The rooms and views are breathtaking, looking out over the harbor, the location is perfect, a few blocks from the Waterfront stop from using the SkyTrain from the airport and it's just a one block walk down to the waterfront itself where there is a plethora of restaurants and yummy eats such as gelato. The staff overall are very accommodating and the buffet breakfast is top notch. I would not hesitate staying here again on our next visit and I would hire Miss Bye in a heartbeat if I owned any type of establishment. Thanks again AMANDA!!! ! Review #24:Renaissance Vancouver Harbourside Hotel The hotel is very nice located, near you will find nice restaurants , delis and one Sven eleven. Our room was fine, and great bed 6 lovely pillows. It was quite and cleans room and has a beautiful view of the harbor (though obstructed by an apartment tower). Bathroom is a small but very clean having Aveda products , the shower was hot and amazing. Globe and Mail was provided in the morning. Breakfast buffet was superb - TONS of fresh fruit and anything else you could want. Quite expensive 26 dollars each. Wi-Fi is crazy expensive at $16 per night... not sure why they charge when the Starbucks around the corner is free. The bathroom is a little small for this type of hotel. Review #25:Stayed here pre-cruise (out of Ballantyne) on points. We walked from the new Canada Line and was a little more of a hike than we thought, but if you are active, it should be fine. Checked in to find that we had a room with gorgeous view of harbor, Stanley Park and a little glimpse of the Lions Gate bridge. Loved the decor in eclectic reds, golds and blacks. Room was clean and beds were comfortable. Had the buffet breakfast in the morning and it was VERY good and the setting was so beautiful. We walked to Granville Island from here (quite a walk) and Stanley Park to rent bikes. Would stay here again in a heart beat! Great way to start a phenomenal vacation. Review #26:I knew that Vancouver wasn't huge, geographically, so I wasn't worried about needing to get to the airport for sidetrips to Calgary, Kelowna and Victoria during my stay. Unfortunately, I hadn't factored in downtown traffic. Because the Harbourside was some distance from the airport, which is actually in Richmond, I found myself at the valet station at 5am three days in a row. The first two days, there was no problem as there was someone on duty each day. The third--a Sunday--a "suit" came to the valet station asking what I wanted. I gave him my parking ticket, and explained that I had to catch a plane. He ran off and drove up in five minutes with my rental car. I offered the gentleman a $10 bill which he declined to accept--explaining to me that he was the manager-on-duty of the Harbourside (Whoa!). I realize this is what five-star service is about, but I still worried about finding my luggage on the sidewalk when I returned to the hotel. I also had faxes placed in envelopes and delivered to my room as soon as they arrived--in one case it was the middle of the night. The night before my day of departure, I explained at the valet station that I had to return my rental car and be through airport security and at my international departure gate at 5:30am. A valet jumped into my rental car and drove me into the underground parking garage. He placed my car near an elevator and gave me my keys. I made my plane with time to spare. I know this sounds like I spent more time *outside* the hotel than *inside* to hotel. But the fact is that without the exceptionally high level of service the Harbourside provided, my visit to Vancouver would have been a complete failure. Review #27:This was the first hotel we stayed at during our tour from Vancouver to Calgary. We upgraded our room to the harbour view and it was worth every penny. The views were amazing. Out of all the hotels we stayed at in Canada this was the best. The room was really nice the bed was really comfortable. The only downside of the this hotel is that you have to pay £10 (just like any other city) per night for parking, however if you are staying in Vancouver for a few days, just get a taxi from the airport. During our 4 days in vancouver we only used the car once. There is some building work going on in front of the hotel so I dont know what the views will be like once this has been done. Review #28:I choose this hotel over the newer Marriott which was across the street from the Renaissance because I wanted a harbour view from my room. The view was limited due to a new high-rise being constructed between the hotel and the shoreline. This was not a major upset as we still commanded some pretty nice views but the room was well-worn and outdated. I normally have room service once or twice but the menu was very limited as were the availability of the restaurants in the hotel. We ate at the buffet for breakfast which was pricey for what was offered. Service was very slow if you ordered anything from the kitchen (e.g. an omelet). Also, the overall ambiance of this hotel is 'dark'. I am use to brightly lit lobbies, corridors and rooms. This was not the case here. I would not recommend this hotel given better choices nearby such as the new Marriott across the street. Review #29:Arrived at this hotel as a group on a geology study-tour. Travel-agent had suggested a luxurious hotel for the final night before we flew back to Scotland.. Despite arriving well after 3 p.m. (check-in time) three of the group's rooms were not ready. We were left hanging about the lobby beside the very posh front door - then were shooed out of the way, as we were told we were blocking the door. We could not leave our luggage as there was a great heap of suitcases, obviously from another group about to depart. After twenty minutes two of us went to see if they would at least offer us a drink and somewhere to sit down. At this point, the young man at the desk phoned someone, and then told us that our rooms were ready. No-one apologised for the delay. The next morning a buffet breakfast has been booked for us in a private room - we were due to go on a tour of Vancouver for the rest of the morning, before headng off to the airport. There were thirty-two people in our group. There were chairs and place-settings for only twenty-four. The one and only waitress was hurtling around like a banshee, trying to fill up the buffet dishes, supply people with tea and coffee, find more dishes and cutlery, not to mention chairs. Two young male managers did appear, and stood around looking concerned - but didn't actually DO anything. It was the most frustrating and unsatisfactory meal. We then went up to our rooms to collect our suitcases and got into the lift. One of the older members of our group tried to keep the doors open for another member, but presumably hit the alarm button by mistake.The alarm went off and the lift continued down to the ground floor - and no member of staff came to investigate if there was a problem. When the last member of our party came down, ten minutes later, the alarm was still going off! Review #30:Trailfinders booked us here as part of our Canadian tour before joining a cruise to Alaska and we were very pleased they did. From the moment we arrived the staff were extremely professional and helpful. The rooms are of an excellent size and the view of the harbour is stunning. One way from the hotel you are within easy walking distance of the cruise terminal which is just next to Gastown and the other way is a beautiful walk along the waterfront, past the marina and into Stanley Park. The buffet breakfast was excellent and the concierge very knowledgeable and helpful in organising our trip to Grouse Mountain. Thank you for making our stay most enjoyable! Review #31:I spent the 4th of July weekend with my husband and we had a marvelous time. The room package came with a free companion ticket and free hot breakfast. We arrived late and had dinner at the restaurant, the server was very friendly and attentive to my special needs ( I try to avoid too much sodium when traveling).... The Halibut dinner was excellent and my husband ordered the filet....delicious!! The room initial room was very small, but I realized we were in Canada, but they promptly upgraded us to a harborview room so the large patio window made all the difference...although no chairs available to sit on the balcony..... I would definitely come back when visiting Vancouver again.... Review #32:I was staying here for business. I thought the hotel was very nice. Bed was very comfortable. Gorgeous view of the harbour (what you can see past the towers in front of you anyway) Residential neighbourhood mostly, so quite quiet. Easy to walk to most shopping on Robson and Granville Streets and the liquor store is only a 1/2 block away. Nice to have a glass of wine in my room after work. The heliport is a very short walk. I thought the front door staff on the most part were friendly although a few turned away when I made eye contact to say 'hello'. They have an amazing gym. Really top notch. Gorgeous indoor pool and hot tub too. Only complaint is that there was no signage for the underground parking. Had to go around the block 3 times before I finally found it. Review #33:was here for 3 nights mid- Aug. Great location. Expensive food  $23 plus for bacon and eggs?? Booked a 2 bedded assessible room and was told it was confirmed. When we got there I was informed it was either 2 dbl. beds with no assessiblity or 1 with a king bed and a chaise with assessiblity. I chose the king bed (I was with my 82 yr old mom and wheelchair bound sister. There is only enough room in the 'assessible' room to get the wheelchair in. Not enough room to get the chair around the room. The bathroom has grab bars at the toilet and in the shower/tub (if you need a roll in shower you are S.O.L)...Had to call twice for the extra bedding so I could sleep on the chaise . When I asked where a certain restrurant was I was told it just just a few blocks away (it was 8 blocks UP HILL and I was pushing a wheelchair). You get 1 towel per person, some days we had shampoo/conditioner and lotion, other days we had no soap ,1 shampoo and 2 lotions. The bed  I was told was comfortable. I was woken up one night at 3am from the alarm clock in some other room. If you are not on the harbor side you get street noise till 2am. Review #34:If business or vacation takes you to the heart of Vancouver the Renaissance Vancouver Hotel Harbourside certainly is a great choice. I got to play tourist for 2 days while my wife attended business meetings. Book a waterside room for a nice view of the north shore of Burrard Inlet, Coal Harbour, mountians, ship traffic, float planes, Stanley Park, etc. Parking garage was $19 a day (ouch). The staff we encountered generally displayed excellent customer service skills (okay, a couple of them registered low in the smile catagory). I am fairly certain that Alexandra at the concierge desk speaks spanish, portuguese & Italian in addition to english. They graciously pointed me to the best bus to Chinatown (it's the #19), the nearest Skytrain station and the Steam Clock in Gastown...yes I said Steam Clock. Oh, just go see it. Public transit is great. Didn't dine at the hotel restaurant. Found breakfast and lunch at cafe's in Chinatown, downtown and Granville Island. Had dinner one night at Joe Fortes on Thurlow St. and the next night at Cardero's Restaurant & Marine Pub on Coal Harbour Quay. Both an easy walk from the hotel. Joe Fortes ain't no Outback Steakhouse, it's a very pleasant restaurant and, dining solo, my dinner bill came to about $40. Life's too short for bad food. Cardero's is a bit noisy but great atmosphere with very good pub-style food. If you're driving into Vancouver remember that there is no expressway to whisk you quickly and effortlessly to downtown. Finding your way should be easy, but you are on surface streets and they can be slow. If you are feeling "touristy" go ahead and see Granville island. Plenty of shops, stores, galleries and food stands, plus the public market to entertain you. The parking there is limited...and that was on a Tuesday morning. Next trip I'm hitting the aquarium in Stanley Park and some of the museums. Review #35:I have stayed at the Renaissance in Downtown Vancouver for 40 nights in 2009 and 70 in 2010 (so far). I have come to rely on the consistant quality of this hotel, it's restaurant, lounge, and the nearby facilities. The lobby restaurant is wonderful - though pick the Tenderloin over the Ribeye. Every night there is a 9pm shot from the cannon at Stanley Park to the North. I would recommend walking to the Olympic Torch across the street to get the full effect of the echo. Review #36:We left booking a hotel in Vancouver to the last minute, and so kinda rushed our booking into this hotel. It turned out to be a great choice - nr downtown, an ocean view room, nr the float planes (essential for that trip to Victoria!) and with the most helpful staff! The construction work didn't bother us too much, although I do wonder what will happen to the great views! Review #37:Well the hotel was superb in every way. The staff caring, friendly and polite. Room was just so perfect, overlooking harbour and float planes. It was my 60th birthday, and they made it soooo special, we cannot thank them enough. Hotel spotless throughout. The best variety of breakfast , and such happy staff. We will deffinately stay here again. If you want a great stay and location, and want to feel special, then stay here. Wow Review #38:This hotel has a great view and is located in a continence location. The pool and gym are very nice. The room is not too spacious but it is still a good size. The bathroom is kind of small but at least it is clean. The parking is terrible and super expensive. The customer service is poor. Our bath tub didn’t drain very well the first night we stayed. We told the front desk in person and asked them to fix it the next morning. However, the bathtub still did not drain well the second night when we showered. Apparently they did not take care of the problem at all. I called the front desk about this problem again, but they told me there was no engineer stand by in the evening. However, we c
