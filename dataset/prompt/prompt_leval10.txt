Review #0:We stayed at the Grand Amsterdam for a combination of business and leisure travel. My husband was traveling for business (making the cost of the hotel less of an issue), while I went sight-seeing. We were generally very happy with the Grand Amsterdam. The room was adequate in size, and nicely appointed. The bed was very comfortable. The bathrooms are well appointed, with nice toiletries and a good shower. I did wish for a double-sink, but those seem to be less common outside the U.S. (I'm not sure who thought up the rectangular toilet seat - very cute, but doesn't fit the round shape of the object sitting on it). We ate at the restaurant and found it very good, if pricey. We also used the gym - it has only three pieces of cardio equipment and one weight machine, but they were all in good condition. We used the pool and sauna - nice options after a day of touring. The hotel is very well located. We don't mind a little walking and only used a cab to take us to the train station when we left. There of lots of shops, restuarants, and attractions very nearby, and the Anne Frank House and Van Gogh Museum are an easy 20 minute walk. One note if you are traveling soon - ask about the ongoing construction or plan to be up by 8:00 a.m. sharp - the pounding on the building is noticable. Review #1:This is a truly great hotel. The decor is really cool, the beds are superbly comfortable, the bathrooms excellent, the food is wonderful. But what makes a great hotel is the staff. I've stayed here twice this year. The first time I was really busy with work and was working at the business centre even after I'd checked out. One of the staff noticed that I'd been beavering away at my laptop for quite a long and asked whether she could bring me a drink. She then brought me a beautiful pot of tea (and I do mean the teapot was very beautiful, but it was also a very touching gesture). When I returned more recently, the person checking me in mentioned that on the previous visit I'd had a problem with room service (it was simply that because I was working I wanted to have dinner in my room and there did not seem to be a room service menu in the room, when I rang room service, one was delivered to my room very promptly) and that problem had been addressed and there were now room service menus in the room. That is really impressive service and excellent follow up by the staff. As much as I love Amsterdam, I will return simply to stay at the Grand. Review #2:Great hotel, fabulous, courteous helpful staff and Guido the concierge among the best ever! Convenient central location, excellent restaurants. Beautiful building and rooms, immaculate, comfortable - Wow!! Only negative was that like most nicer European hotels, they expect you to eat a large and very expensive breakfast buffet. A la carte only available via room service. Great guest lounge on main floor with 2 complimentary computers (and free internet) for guest use was a nice plus. Review #3:We stayed at this hotel for two nights, as my 40th birthday was on the 29th December. We had complimentary champagne upon arrival. The location is perfect for exploring beautiful Amsterdam and the staff were extremely helpful. We used the spa which was relaxing and therapeutic. We enjoyed champagne with the staff on the Thursday evening and tried some delicious cheese! Our room was comfy and was regularly tidied and freshened up. It was a birthday that I will always remember and I would love to return one day. Amsterdam is a fantastic and architecturally wonderful city. Review #4:Checked in to the hotel on Thursday, greeted by a host and a lovely Butler Domingo! We were celebrating our anniversary and were treated like a prince and princess! our luggage was misplaced so stress levels were up, but the butler chased this up regularly! We had a suite room which was outstanding with views of the canal, The bathroom was lovely, and the bedroom so romantic! Lovely size bed! Loved everything about the stay, hotel is a walk way from all the shops/rest and the staff are all so pleasant! We even got treated like VIP at the restaurant Domingo booked for us where we got a special table too! Loved it, want to do it al again! Thank you for the amazing stay! Review #5:Sofitel's renowned service in addition to Dutch hospitality have made our stay at this hotel a wonderful experience. The contrast of modern furnishing in a historical building dating back to the 1500s makes this hotel ideal for a romantic getaway. The guest relations manager greeted us from the lobby and escorted us to the room. The entire staff were eager to please us. The guest-staff get together on thursdays with flowing champagne glasses and finger foods is just one example of the warmth and hospitality you'll expect. Dam square is right across the corner and the red light district is a five minute walk away, making its location ideal regardless of what your idea of fun is. The beds were extremely comfortable and the view of the canal from the room was just perfect. I highly recommend this hotel to everyone and I would definitely stay there if I ever go to Amsterdam again. Review #6:We stayed at The Grand Sofitel in Amsterdam on the nights of June 4, 5 and 6 in suite 336. Two other couples in our traveling party also stayed at The Grand on the same nights at our recommendation. WE ALL HAD A VERY ENJOYABLE STAY. From my first contact with Sanne Pisters in reservations to the last contact with the concierge as we all left for the airport our stay WAS PERFECT. You have a wonderful property. I own the Ocean Lodge and The Lodges at Cannon Beach in Cannon Beach, Oregon a beachside town located 90 minutes west of Portland Oregon so I know good service when I see it. Your rooms were clean and well appointed. Everything worked properly and was explained by the valet. Your morning breakfast buffet was very complete including the hot entrees we ordered after getting fruit and pastry. The Grand is a wonderful spot to stay because it is central to all of the activities we planned. Once day four in our group went to the train station and rented bikes to ride the dikes across the river, two others walked to the Zoo. Others went to the Anne Frank House, on canal tours and to museums. At the end of each day we met back at The Grand for a quiet moment of respite. We enjoyed two late evenings outside in the terrace bar and one room service when one of our party twisted a knee and needed a night off from walking. Your concierge selected perfect places for us to eat where they clearly knew we were Sofitel guests. Each night we had a nice hot shower and then fell asleep in the wonderful beds - ready for a new day, All of your employees made us feel at home and we will be returning to The Grand when we take a cruise from Amsterdam to Basel, Switzerland. Review #7:We stayed at Sofitel The Grand Amsterdam for 2 nights in early Dec 2008. We took a Connexxion hotel shuttle from the Schiphol airport, and the trip took about 25-30 minutes (with a few other hotel drop-offs). When we tried to check-in at Sofitel, we were told that our booking was not available. We then figured that we were at the wrong hotel (i.e. Sofitel but not Sofitel The Grand)! Fortunately the Connexxion driver was still outside the hotel, and he gave us a ride to the right place. So make sure you communicate the correct hotel name to your driver if you're going to stay there. The hotel itself was a historic and magnificent site. We stayed in a Sofitel suite with courtyard view. The room was huge with a large bed and lounge area, a separate room with closets and a working desk, and a bathroom. The decor and furniture looked a bit old-fashioned at first (e.g. colorful / patterned draperies, tapestry sofa, oak table, etc. ), but we actually quite liked them after a while as the ambience was cozy and very different from other contemporary / modern hotels we had previously stayed in. The most important thing was we felt comfortable in the suite. The courtyard (from our window) was nice - would be relaxing to have a walk around there. However, as the weather was rather cold and rainy, we did not spend time out there during our stay. The hotel offered turn-down service in the early evening. Some people might not like it but we were fine and appreciated it. We also enjoyed a complimentary welcome drink at the restaurant. Hotel staff were friendly and helpful. We bought our tickets to the Van Gogh Museum at the reception / concierge (to avoid line-up at the museum). A hotel staff also recommended a great Indonesian restaurant to us (can't remember the name now...but I did take one of their cards). To sum it up, we were happy with our stay and would certainly go back next time we're in Amsterdam. Review #8:We had the pleasure of staying at the Sofitel Grand Amsterdam and can say it was one of the best hotel stays we have ever experienced. Once you enter the grounds of the hotel, the crazy outside world just disappears.... The hotel itself is stunning. On check in you are shown to your room and the features of the room & hotel are explained to you. The compliementary dried fruits & syrup biscuits are a lovely touch. The nespresso coffee machine was also appreciated! The central courtyard of the hotel is a oasis, the perfect place to enjoy a glass of champagne. We had dinner at the restaurant, the menu is fish based and we completely enjoy both the food and the amibence. All the staff we spoke with were outstanding. The staff are extremely friendly yet professional, a perfect balance. We can not reccommend a stay a this Grand Hotel strongly enough!! ! Review #9:Very poor in every respect, bar closed early, barman had to look up how to make a cocktail, cold water in the shower, TV that didn't work - (I could do on). If you take advantage of one of the special offers you can expect a second rate service, a noisey room and staff who really don't want you to return. Review #10:This is a great value,the staff are warm and welcoming,the rooms are wonderfully well-equipped,the breakfast is excellent,the location is perfect and the whole hotel is spotless. Everything was great, they had free wifi,a balcony,laundry service,breakfast included,and they were happy to help with whatever we needed.The hotel itself was very clean & comfortable. Review #11:My husband and I stayed for three nights in August and our overall impressions of the hotel were extremely favourable from the excellent location and impressive decor to the cleanliness of the room. Our only gripe was with the service, both in the bar and the restaurant when we had breakfast. It was painfully slow, and the waiting staff suffered from tunnel vision, ignoring our attempts to catch their attention. Someone needs to do a time and motion exercise to improve things - why have waitresses standing around doing nothing because (presumably) it is not in their remit to, for example, take your order but instead just to clear tables? That irritation aside, tho, I would not hesitate to stay at the hotel again. Review #12:The beds at The Grand are actually like sleeping on cloud. As a couple who sleep on a Tempurpedic in the US, this bed is ten times more comfortable. Incredible sleeping on this lovely feather bed with a feather duvet. The service is impeccable and I'm sure they would cheerfully scrape gum off the sole of my shoe had I asked. Every detail was attended to and the turn-down service included the most incredible chocolate truffles I've ever had! it's right on the canal and just a block from the boat tours, and the neighborhood where you can walk all day to see the lovely touristy shops or the high end shopping district. The Grand keeps taxis on hand for a ride at a moments notice. This place has a historic history and the breakfast buffet was delicious. We're American so they made lovely scrambled eggs from scratch and there were plenty of meats, cheeses, fresh fruit, and breads including those heavenly croissants. In case you can't tell this place ROCKS! It's well worth the price. Review #13:My wife and I stayed at this hotel April 30- May 2. We got to the hotel at noon; check-in was 3 PM. Front desk finally gave us a room at 4:30 PM. The room they provided was on two levels Bed on lower level and bath and closet up 5 steps. Very challenging to maneuver around and use toilet at night. We spoke to many people and a lot of them got stuck with this type of room. Breakfast was included and dining room was disorganized. You had to hail servers to get tea, coffee or hot food. Cold food was buffet. Quality was good but a pain to constantly get someone to bring hot items. This is a big hotel in an old building which could not be renovated sufficiently to keep old world charm with modern conveniences. The service in this hotel is poor, the rates high and they are disorganized. My wife and I are from USA and a fellow guest from Germany commented about the many quality problems at this hotel. I would avoid this hotel even if they offered a great rate. Review #14:The Grand is suitably located at the heart of the medieval city and the atmosphere has a touch of real "grandieuse". However, the staff totally ruined it for us: We booked through hotel's own website and opted for the "stay 4 -pay 3 nights" package. It was clear that breakfast was not inclusive and as we always enjoy our breakfast during vacation, we clicked the extra "breakfast" option as well. We received shortly a confirmatory email, with a total reservation price which included breakfast as requested. However, after checking-in and during breakfast, staff seemed unaware that we decided to include the breakfast option during our reservation and insisted that breakfast was not included in the price. Staff also seemed unwilling (or uncapable) to check the details of our reservation with their own reservation confirmatory email. Thankfully we brought a printout with us, and brought it to the reception desk. The scene with the Reservation Manager taking curious looks and questioning their own email was less than pleasant and unheard of from a 5 star establishment. We received no apologies for this annoyance during our stay. For the history, the balance (for the stay 4-pay 3 package incl. breakfast) was 4 euros less than our initial total reservation price!!! Sofitel The Grand management really needs to set things straight with regards to their reservation, billing and attitude towards guests policies. Review #15:Had an excellent stay. Have rarely encountered such service-oriented staff in The Netherlands. My room was spacious and well equipped. Location is perfect. You get the feel of life along the canals and it is an easy walking distance from key sights and shops, including the flower market. Did not try the restaurants. Yes, it is pricey but you do get a lot in return! Review #16:We got this hotel at a last minute bargain, and I am glad we did. The room, although small (but not smaller than normal European hotel rooms), was very comfortable. The king-size bed was fantastic and I always enjoy a place that gives you a robe with the towels. Very convienent, right next to Dam Square and walkable from the Train Station. I would definitely stay here again. Review #17:The Sofitel is located right next to the RLD. Even in cold weather, it seemed to be a short walk from everything. We stayed in a suite that offered butler service. The service was outstanding. We have stayed at other top hotels/resorts (Four Seasons, Ritz) and this particular Sofitel location was up to snuff. Luis and Domingo went out of their way to help us out, as did the check-in staff. We also used the amenities (indoor pool) and my wife and her sister used the spa services. Great time! They also have working Macs with printers in the lobby area that came in really handy. Review #18:We often travel to Amsterdam and most hotels in the city are small, old, worn, as well as being expensive. We stayed at the Radisson Blu last year and although the rooms were big, it was rather dark in the room and felt more like a business hotel. This year we stayed at the Sofitel and we were very impressed by the renovations they've done. Just walking into the large front courtyard gives you a relaxed feeling right away making you feel at home. The hotel is conveniently located in the city centre of Amsterdam. We stayed for 2 nights in interconecting Superior rooms. The bathrooms were brand new and large (no bath, just shower) but the rooms were compact. We have no complaints about the service, it was sometimes a bit quirky but we wouldn't say it was bad service. Staff were all very nice. There are 2 iMacs in the cozy lounge by the lobby with free access to the internet. Otherwise in the room it's 17 Euros a day. We had the buffet breakfasts on both mornings which had a great selection but at 32 Euros per person you'd hope so. We had dinner in Bridges one night and although the raw seafood platter was extremely good, the main course was average. We'd definitely come back to this hotel again. It's very comfortable and a great place to stay in Amsterdam. The hotel has a similar feel to the Sofitel St James in London. Review #19:I travel a lot and this is one of the best hotel in the world. Everything is perfect, staff, service and room. Location is just amazing, walking distance to a lot of major tourist destination. As an Accor card member, this is one on the only hotel where the card was recognized and acknowledge. Well do not hesitate, if you go to Amsterdam this is the place you want to stay. Review #20:I've stayed at the Sofitel "The Grand Amsterdam" hotel a number of times and found it to be outstanding. The city center location is excellent while also being quite and just a little bit removed from the hustle and bustle. I've found the staff to be initially reserved but warm up quickly if you actual converse with them. NOTE: My stays were a few years ago so the Feb 2010 date was the earliest date in the review menu, Review #21:We spent 3 nights at the Grand and stayed in one of their newly renovated apartments, truly amazing with its oversize living-room (complimentary nespresso machine included) and bathroom (best shower ever) and its quiet, comfortable bedroom. Nice view on a small canal (sleepy swans drifting slowly at night, their neck twisted back to rest their head on their feathers, a sight to be seen). I stayed in this hotel 5-6 years ago and it looks so much better now : I remember a very outdated decoration in the bedroom but everything looks fresh now. There were beautiful pink and violet tulips everywhere in the hotel, it was gorgeous. The breakfast room is impressive, not to be missed. Breakfast itself is good although not as good as Sofitel London or Berlin. The food at the restaurant was good, not amazing, and the service a bit slow although restaurant was only half full. Location is very good, red light district very close but you wouldn't believe it, there was absolutely no nuisance from it. Would definitely recommend. Review #22:In many ways this is a lovely hotel in a great location but they do enough things wrong to mar your stay. Be wary of the front desk staff. They will either treat you with respect or contempt but you never know which it will be. The rooms are dated; the wall paper was peeling in mine and carpet had pulled away from the wall in many places. But the rooms are large (for Europe) and the bathroom was spotless. The pool and locker room were also clean and bright but if you book a massage you must pay in cash. Be prepared to sleep with earplugs. There is no other way to put it. The noise level is bad. Review #23:My husband and me booked an escapade, at promotional rates, got upgraded to an apartment suite! Although we didn't use the first floor, it was a nice touch! The location is great; although close to everything, walking distance from the train station, the Dam, the main places, it is an oasis of quiet, a chic ambiance. The hotel itself is worth seeing, with its colored glasses and reminiscences of distinguished guests from bygone times. We didn't try the facilities though, but what we saw was good enough. The service is excellent, (very untypical of the locals, unfortunately), from the reception staff, to Udo, the concierge who makes miracles, or Peter, the bell boy. Would go back, for sure! Review #24:I have stayed two nights in a superior room at the Sofitel. I must say it is not as nice as other Sofitel. The room although 2 levels above Classic room is rather small and furnished ok, and not upscale. The first room that was assigned stunk chemical mized with smoke odors. I was changed for another room without much problem. I did not like the low pressure shower head and the price ( circa EUR 30-35) of the breakfast. The restaurant is not well lighted and the food is ok but not worth EUR30. I liked the location and the pool. In general, l think the room was overpriced (360/night) and the service good but not like with the other Sofitel. Review #25:I had the pleasure of spending 7 nights at the Sofitel Grand Demure in Amsterdam while attending a conference with a girl friend. The Decor was just beautiful and the internal garden just lovely, this Hotel is very Grand and stands upto its name. The weather was not so kind to us but the Hotel Staff were excellent. We had been at The Burj in Dubai before arriving and I can say the Burj staff could learn at lot from the staff at this Hotel. The Hotel is under renovation and only had around 30 rooms available. At no time did we hear the renovations or see work people, it was all handled very well. Our room over looked the front courtyard and canal which was pleasant and it was so nice to be able to have the window open for fresh air at night. It is close to the Red Light area but you wouldnt know it, is very safe. We used the pool and steam room which was very clean. The breakfast buffet was excellent, we didnt need to eat for the rest of the day, the fresh stawberries and raspberries were a real treat. I am the Latte queen, coming from Australia we are used to our coffee a certain way, the dutch are not so much into Lattes but they managed to master my tastes very early on in the stay. The staff made our stay very enjoyable and I would recommend to other travellers. I can imagine this Hotel will be even more Grand after the renovation, well done Soitel and thank you for a pleasant stay. You will remain on my list as a beautiful place to stay and excellent service. Review #26:We loved staying here. We realized it was a splurge, but it was worth it. Every aspect of our stay was wonderful. No one mentions the amazing exterior detailing of the hotel or the courtyard entry. Very charming. The Guest Services person, Zsa Zsa, went out of her way to greet us and treat us warmly. My only complaint is that is was several blocks from the nearest tram. The pool, although below ground level and small, is still lovely. I don't think it would be my choice with small children due to its sophistication. Review #27:Checked in at very short notice for one night via the tourist office - which was originally all that was available. The staff was very helpful in arranging for us to extend to three nights. The rooms are very pleasant ,comfortable and clean with enough of a feeling of luxury to make you feel good about the place. Great location for the town centre but from our room no view at all. Breakfast was good and as plentiful as you want- if a little erratic in the organisation. Hotel and Bar staff very pleasant. A few hiccoughs in that they ended up taking several hundred Euro too much credit card authorisation over and above the room costs even if you accept that they should hold authorisation in case of extras. The receptionist soon found the mistake when it was pointed out, and it was put right after checkout. They were also very good in rectifying the misunderstanding over whether or not breakfast was included for the extended two nights. The building itself is internally beautiful and historic. Unfortunately my wife was put off using the bar facilities after we saw several mice. We were told, with profuse apologies, that this was an ongoing problem during nearby canal restoration works. Review #28:The hotel is in the centre of town so we walked to all the attractions that we wanted to see. The standard rooms are not big but the suitable for us. The used the hotel transfer to and from the airport which made everything very easy as we arrived at different times and no one had to organize money. The highlight of our stay was the concierge Mr Udo Eshuijs who organized medicine for our daughter who had asthma and needed a puffer. He organized the hotel doctor to send a script to the chemist and sent a taxi to collect it then delivered it to the room personally. He suggested various restaurants that were all great and made our stay memorable. If you stay please use his recommendations. Review #29:So beautiful and modern and perfectly clean. Great place for travelers who like nothing but the best. The location was excellent, so close to everything, but beware, it is also very close to the red light district, so, if you may be offended by it, don't stay there or don't take a right once you leave the hotel. It didn't bother us at all so I didn't see it as a problem. The room we stayed was pretty small, but the bed was the most comfortable ever! the curtains were heavy and dark so you could relax and nap at any time of the day. The bathroom was large and very modern and the toiletries excellent. I may be going to other Sofitels around the world! Review #30:Booked room type (deluxe king) not available "due to construction" but only found out when we got to the room. Large cobweb in the room and stained grouting in shower area. Room service order delivered incorrectly. 7am alarm call received, waking us up, which we'd not requested! The hotel is in a very good location but so are many less expensive ones! Sofitel are off my list - this is meant to be one of their best and it's really not that good. Review #31:Me and my wife stayed at this wonderful hotel for five days and loved it. Great atmosphere, beautiful architecture and even better service. This hotel can be recommended to everyone who is visiting Amsterdam. It is near al the big tourist attractions and the Central Station. The rooms are very comfortable and the interior is outstanding. This hotel has my vote for best hotel in Amsterdam! Review #32:We have just returned from 3 nights at the Sofitel Grand, staying in a Junior Suite. Our welcome was excellent making us feel as though we had definitely made the right choice. All the staff were friendly throughout the stay although we had a few blips with level of service which is a shame as the hotel has a lot of the ingredients to make it excellent. The location is interesting! In a beautiful building with a lot of history. Be warned though, it is VERY close to the red light district. We are certainly not prudes but the location of the hotel meant that, mainly in the evenings, the area was full of large groups of men on what seemed like 'lads nights out'! I also hate to say that a lot of them were English too who seemed to have had a sherry too many!! Hence lots of noise and lager drinking in the bars nearby the hotel!! Not conducive to a romantic night out!! On our last evening the gas in the hotel kitchens went out and therefore the menu in the restaurant was extremely limited. We had to revert to room service (again a restricted menu because of the problem) and no apology was made for this inconvenience. In our mind the hotel should have given notice that there was a problem so that we had time to make alterntiave arrangements (apparently it had been out all day). Not good for a 5 star hotel. We would return with a group of mates for fun weekend. We wouldn't return for a romantic weekend away with a partner! ! Review #33:Just back from a weekend at the The Grand with two other couples, the hotel itself is on a great site and very central. The rating is five star but is probably more like a very high four as some of the place is in need of a spruce up (its not in bad nick just not five star) however the staff more than made up for any slight shortfall with great service and lots of handy tips. The Sunday bruch is also a good way to come round after a heavy night with a great varied buffet and hair of the dog included in the price. If you have a Sofitel loyalty card the room upgrades a well worth it. We would go back again. Review #34:Only a few steps away from the hustle and bustle around the Old Church and yet as quiet as a mansion in the countryside: That's the Amsterdam Grand Sofitel for you. It's so centrally located that you can actually walk from Amsterdam Centraal train station. Also some of the best restaurants are in close proximity. The hotel used to be a convent and later Amsterdam city hall. Don't miss the council hall, the mayor's office and the marriage chamber â€“ they are all open to the public. Review #35:just returned from the sofitel booked a surprise 50th birthday for my husband. hotel ,rooms, staff, and location were fantastic. the hotel staff were wonderful and made every effort to make our stay special. they presented my husband with a cake and domingo the waiter in the resturant was very hospitable and really nice guy, providing us with information of the city . thanks again to the sofitel we will be back. lorraine, mick robinson and john and lynne hewitt. ps domingo enjoy your friends wedding dont get to drunk you have to work the next day x Review #36:After a glorious refurb. this hotel is looking stunning. The staff seem really to enjoy their work, they are very smart too. Service is superb, friendly, yet very professional. We were asked if we wanted to upgrade to a junior suite for 60 euros a night, we did and were not disappointed. The decor is plush, the bathroom in black slate, a huge bath -freestanding and glorious toiletries. We had views from our 5th floor across the Amsterdam rooftops and canals. The hotel could not be in a better position, close to bars, restaurants, sleaze - if you want it and shops. The prices were what you would expect in a 5* hotel, the bar prices were actually reasonable. There is building work in the spa area, we didn't notice so much as a workman, this will be finished in August. We had room service, the food was decent quality, but the menu is limited, great croque monsieur though. There is a simply stunning courtyard bar and restaurant area, which was always lively, being a courtyard it was also an oasis from the hedonistic delights outside. The room was quiet, with excellent air conditioning, TV had BBC1 and2 and a few other English Channels. Parking was 50 Euros a night, but that was to be expected here. Also bottled water seemed very expensive compared to other drinks. The nicest touch was when they brought the car when we left and there was a gift for the journey home; two bottles of water, two muesli bars and two wipe up towelettes, how sweet is that? Review #37:The location of the hotel is just great. It is right in the center of the city. You can walk just about anywhere from the hotel. And the walk from the Central train station is only about 10 minutes. Front reception was very friendly. A man showed us to our room which was on the fourth floor in the corner. They called it a junior suite with two twin beds. Windows looked out onto the front of the hotel over the canal. Very nice views. Bathroom was fantastic. Big tub and separate shower with a window. There was a TV in the bathroom and stereo speakers. The only thing I didn't care for was the glass swing open bathroom doors which did not give enough privacy. Room was very clean. Beds were very comfortable. Some of the best I have experienced. Plenty of room to walk around and separate closets to put clothes. I did not try the restaurant. It was expensive, but looked very nice. The courtyard in the center of the hotel is very nice for drinks. A little expensive, the the atmosphere is worth it. There is a coffee shop right outside the hotel. Every morning and afternoon we would walk by and smell the pot that they were smoking there. Didn't bother me (it's Amsterdam after all), but I wasn't expecting something like that so close to the hotel. Staff at checkout was very friendly. Overall, my stay here was excellent and I would definitely return. The sofitel beds and pillows are so comfortable. This sofitel ranks in the top 3 that I have stayed at. Get a good deal by booking a promotion through their website and you won't regret it. Review #38:A great hotel for lots of money. The room we rese
