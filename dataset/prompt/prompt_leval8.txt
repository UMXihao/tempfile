Review #0:Hilton Miami Downtown is fine if you are a business traveler. Rate are cheap, but breakfast was not included and hotel charges $20 for breakfast buffet. I bit too much for the USA and the quality is mediocre at best. Rooms are spacious, but dated. Hotel could do with a refurbishment. Pool was dirty. Overall, it was ok for the money and acceptable while on a business trip, but if I stayed in the hotel for holidays, it would be very disappointing. Review #1:This hotel was booked for us through our travel agent - it was near the airport & near the port of Miami where we were leaving on a cruise. Though I found the hotel very pricey (for us) I'm sure you could get a much better rate on line. The room was nice & we sort of had a view of the ocean - the staff was excellent - from the front desk to the valet! We picked up a car through Enterprise at the airport & was allowed to drop it off at the hotel the next day, very convenient, since the cruise line was supplying a shuttle for us to the pier. Since we paid $210 for the night I thought we'd get free parking - we used the valet service for $28 (plus tips) which we found pricey also. We didn't stay there long, it was basically a place to sleep for the night so considering that I thought the $210 for the room & $28 for the parking was VERY high but I really had no complaints about the hotel or the staff. And it is a very lovely place. Review #2:Despite some negative comments that we read on this site we still decided to give the Hilton a chance because the location was perfect for our trip. I must say we were extremely disappointed with our stay there. The renovations were the least of our worries. The room was nice. We had a Jr. Suite with the Bay view. The room was very spacious and nicely put together. HOUSEKEEPING: Never understood that there were 4 people in the room (room can hold 5) and choose to only put towels for 3 each day we were day (4 days) despite many calls to the front desk. They also did an extremely lousy job in cleaning the room. They would leave dirty glasses and leave new ones and they did not change the sheets. VALET: I must say the only friendly people at this hotel were the actually valet driversâ€¦those in the Valet booth were extremely rude and will forget to give your keys to a driver to get your car (happened to several guests) RENOVATIONS: Drilling started at 7am right outside our window. We made a complainant and were told we could have a free breakfast. When we went to retrieve the breakfast we were told that we couldnâ€™t get it and were accused of lying about getting a free breakfast. FRONT DESK: Members of the front desk staff were extremely rude and condescending!! Messages are not sent to the manager but rather put to the side. We finally spoke to one front desk manager who compensated us for one nights stay because of our troubles. We were pleased until the day of check out when we dealt with an â€œassistant front desk managerâ€� who gave us trouble with our reimbursement. Long story short itâ€™s a good thing I spent more time out of the hotel than in because my stay at the Downtown Miami Hilton could have ruined my entire vacation. Review #3:One or two issues during our stay included :- Housekeeping - at least 2 days out of the 5 our room was not made up and we had to chase housekeeping. Don't really need this on holiday especially when you have been out really early say on an excursion and you return late afternoon/early evening to find room not cleaned or replenished. Excursions booked via hotel consierge could only be paid for with cash. As previous review on Hilton Bentley this seems to be a policy throughout the Miami area. Other travellers we spoke to experienced the same. Cannot even charge to room account. Bar service at busy times was a little haphazard - incorrect orders although they did make amends for errors. Pool area although at roof level and could be quite a haven staff appeared once again overwhelmed at busy times - could not keep on top of towel demand and allowed guests to bring bottles/glasses into the pool area. One issue with the executive lounge access - hotel literature stated the lounge should have been open from 6.00 am - this was not the case and when we arrived on one occasion to grab breakfast before leaving for the day we were told to "try later lounge not opening yet staff had not arrived". We felt that an establishment of this nature in this location and carrying the Hilton brand should have made staff available to man the lounge at the times stated. That said we enjoyed our time Downtown and the location of the hotel is good especially for one/two night cruise passengers. Review #4:A group of three of us stayed at this motel during October 9th thru October 13th. My opinion is that this motel was extremely unorganized during this time. Upon arrival at the motel my party was told that we couldn't be checked into a room despite paying our trip in advance because they were having issues receiving payment from the vendor. We had our payment receipts and confirmations in hand and had also called in advance to confirm before arriving. We have to stand around for about two hours before being checked in. Upon checking in the room they assigned us was the wrong type. We had to go back downstairs to be assigned another room. When were assigned a new room the keys didn't work so we had to go back to have them activated. The room we finally received was very nice. We stayed in 724 which was a one bedroom suite. It was very spacious and well kept. On the upside the manager bought us dinner and drinks at the restaurant for our inconvenience at check-in and he was very apologetic and nice. The food at the restaurant was excellent and the service was great. For the most part the staff was very professional and on top of their job. There was a male bartender that in my opinion was very rude, unprofessional and obviously doesnâ€™t like his job, but that was my only negative encounter. We didn't rent a car upon arrival, but met a really nice cab driver who took us everywhere we wanted to go for the whole time we were there. This was an expensive option, but it was convenient since neither of us in the party was familiar with Miami. One of the downsides to this motel is the location. There is no food or entertainment around. There is a Checkers and a Burger king across the street. Overall the stay at this Hotel was satisfactory. Review #5:I found the hotel staff to be very welcoming and accommodating. They provided me a room with a great view, and my room was very clean and equipped appropriately. The hotel restaurant was adequate; however, the staff here also strived to please. The view of the bay was incredible, and my bed was very comfortable. A huge group of teenagers were staying in the hotel, and kids were all over the place until late at night...flooding the lobby, elevators, and public space. I finally had to take my drink from the bar to my room as a result of all of the noise and lack of supervision. Kids were in the hallway during the night slamming doors and making noise. I called the front desk, they responded, but little control over the situation. I would hope that there would be a cerfew and expectations of adult supervision in the future as I got little sleep as a result of the noise. Other than the noise and kids, it was a good hotel. Review #6:This hotel is nice , but for a business traveller is far from ideal , i arrived with no sleep and had to pop a coupe of earplugs to be able to , the beds are great and rooms are spacious and beautiful view but the walls are paper thin and you can hear crystal clear conversation tvs sex ect coming from the other room ,you can also hear the hallway noise amplified times 4.. there is no minibar which is also quite annoying when u are in business as usually you need drinks and snaks at hand ,, room service was ok and inexpensive compared to other Hiltons I have been at ..had the Chicken quesadillas which where not bad but artificial cheese , beware ... this hotel is far from everywhere touritsy and you need a car or taxi to move around , this was not an issue for me as i only needed the room to sleep and eat and had a driver.. an Ok hotel but too noisy to book it again , probably best for a group and tourist trip, avoid if in Buisness and looking for peace Review #7:Stayed here for 2 nights - excellent value for money! Spring fling rate of $125 which included a food credit for $50, champagne and late check-out. Our room was nicely decorated, great linens, flat screen tv and a beautiful view of Miami skyline. As we had a car ,the location was not a problem.South Beach is just a short drive across the bridge and we took a taxi to Bayside.We ordered room service for breakfast and it was excellent. Review #8:This is my second night here at Hilton hotel downtown miami. I love love love it!!! Clean and spacious,everybody is very polite and helpfull. Thank you all for making our stay unique!!! My only reccomendation would be providing free WiFi connection up in the rooms.not only at the lobby. I would love to enjoy that when i return. This is definetely not my last time here!! We still have two more nights to enjoy here!!! A beautiful place!! We feel so VIP;-) Review #9:We enjoyed our stay at the Hilton Miami Downtown. It pays to have be a Gold member of Hilton Honors. We were upgraded to a much nicer room with a terrific view of the water and access to the concierge room. Cold water bottles in their mini fridge, fruit, complimentary breakfast in the morning! What more could we ask! Excellent customer service. Review #10:Selected this hotel for a group/work event. Working with Domingo in sales was the best part about this. He consistently had suggestions that were perfect. I don't generally plan events for work and so Domingo took the helm and provided the direction needed. The meeting rooms and lodging rooms were very nice. You don't generally go wrong with a Hilton. In this case, it was the staff that made the event run smoothly. Also, the food was far above the standard conference selection. Review #11:My wife and I stayed here as a 1 night pre-cruise hotel. I had bid on this thorugh one of those "find out the name after you commit" websites. We got the room, taxes and breakfast for $90. Excellent value. The room was great especially the bedding. Each of the staff we had interactions with were very helpful. Next time I go to Maimi I will stay at the Hilton. The hotel is a very short walk from the Metromover whcih we took to Bayside Marketplace. Review #12:I won't restate what has been said in earlier reviews. This is a stay overnight for a cruise hotel. I am on business and an $8 cab ride to downtown. The hotel is not convenient to anything or anyplace. The hotel sorely lacks business services...no FedEx supplies and no one that even understands enough about business needs to ask about supplies. The one issue i must stress is do not--I repeat--do not take the overhead train cars to or from the hotel area after 6pm. Regardless of what you are told it is not safe for anyone. If you don't know the system you will go around in circles and the cars are invested with local hoodlums and drunks. There is no police presence...ever! Last night i took it back from Bayside and the car was filled with drunk teens that were looking for a fight. They don't get off they just ride in circles and look for trouble. There were two young girls on board that were terrified...I told them to get off the tram with me--they did and I put them in a cab to their hotel. I have been travelling to Miami for years and it just gets worse every year. The downtown is a ghost town except for a couple of hotels and Bayside. Do not wander off the main strip! One other note..the restaurant in the hotel is nice but the waiters are drenched in cologne so that is all you smell and taste. I complained to the "manager" and she told me that it was "their culture". Huh? So, if you are staying one night and then heading to the cruise terminal it is fine...anything more than that look at a more upscale place in a better area of town. Review #13:I had great difficulty getting a room in Miami as it was Super Bowl week end and so used some HHonors points to stay here. I was delighted to be upgraded to Executive Level something I don't think Starwood or IC Hotels do when using points. The hotel was full and jumping with lively but good natured Colts fans and had a fantastic atmosphere. In spite of everything, the hotel coped very well and it was great - food, staff, room, lounge all excellent. Being downtown the hotel is a bit lacking in local amenities. Bayside Plaza is a short taxi ride away which is a lot of fun especially on Super Bowl week end and the Metromover is just a block away which gives access to Metrorail. This will get you to Dadeland Mall, a good place for shopping and gifts to take home. Review #14:This hotel was great. My girlfriend and I got it for a great price. The room was very nice, as was the bathroom. The room was quite large. The bed was extremely comfortable and the AC worked beautifully. It was very clean. Service was friendly and on top of things. Concierge desk was extremely helpful (leave a tip). Room service was great - they had great 24 hour food - try the conch chowder, the conch fritters, key lime pie - I could keep going, everything was delicious. The restaurant inside the hotel had delicious plates and the breakfast buffet was reasonably priced and delicious. The outdoor pool and patio were awesome and not even that busy. The hotel is a three minute walk to the Metromover which will take you to Bayside in a couple of minutes where there is nightlife, shops, drinks, and restaurants. After 6 nights at South Beach right beside Ocean Drive, this hotel and downtown Miami (particularly Bayside) were a great escape for us. Relaxing versus the 24 hour party going on at South Beach (though that was great as well). This hotel was just great, exactly what you would expect from a Hilton. This hotel was awesome. Review #15:We asked for Towels - 5 minutes later they were there We had room service - said it would take 25 minutes - was there in 15 We needed more pillows - there in 10 minutes Housekeeping was a pleasure and our room was always made up early. The value is terrific and attention makes it even more stellar. They Aim to please and have true hospitality - Review #16:I thought I would be staying downtown but this hotel is about 1 1/2 miles north of the downtown center. The hotel, its rooms and amenities were all very nice. The staff was accommodating and friendly. They did charge for wifi however, which seems unnecessary. Some tips: The parking is very expensive - $35 for valet and $25 for self-park. After paying the first night, i parked on 17th Terrace north of hotel the second night for free. If you are not leaving the hotel early, you pay $1.50 per hour between 7am and 10pm. A quick stroll in the morning up 5 blocks to the tiled Barcardi building is worthwhile. Review #17:pros: Room was clean though a little tight and the city view was great at night. Friendly stuff. Coffee was amazing. cons: the first floor was for moter. Valet parking was over $25. The main lobby was not actually on the second floor - confusing. TV was not functioning properly. Review #18:Nice, clean hotel with great view. I enjoyed staying here but I don't understand why there isn't free internet like in all other hotels I stayed in during my 3-week vacation. Free internet is available only in lobby downstairs and if you want internet in your room, you have to pay for it. That's a big MINUS. If you have a car, you have choice of vallet parking or self parking. Review #19:The hotel itself was great. Rooms were clean and the staff was nice except for the front desk clerk who double-charged me and my friend's credit cards. When we tried to get answers, he waved his hands in our face and dismissed us and told us to talk to someone else in the morning. But other than that, not a bad place to stay. Review #20:My two daughters and I stayed here for 2 nights after a cruise. I had prepaid for a junior suite and requested a higher floor room with a nice bayview and early check-in if possible. I also told the front desk manager Christopher that it was a special trip as both my daughters had birthdays. When we got to the hotel, around 11a.m, room wasn't ready, but they checked our bags and we went straight to the pool. I was told they would put a rush on getting the room ready and they asked for my cell phone. By 12:30 p.m, I got a call on my cell phone to inform me our room was ready. Beautiful room, gorgeous view. I called to thank Christopher and he even remembered that my girls had birthdays and sent up some treats for them. Thank you so much!! The only thing I found strange was that there was no mini fridge in the room, even for a suite our size. Review #21:I was a bit worried from the reviews about the Hilton. After staying there, I think some of these people that complain either are used to staying at the Ritz-Carlton or just too damn picky. We got there on Thursday night and didn't have to stand in any lines to check in. The front desk guy was nice enough to give us a room facing the bay after we requested it although what they had available was on the 4th floor. The room had two huge windows with a nice view and it was nice and cleanly decorated. The buffet breakfast (whcich was part of the room rate) was very good I must say, although it was the same every day, but we didn't mind). We were able to grab some bottles of water and fruit on our way out for the day. Another positive was the free internet service in the lobby (they had 3 computers you could use as well as wireless if you had a laptop) We were also able to avoid paying the $28 parking fee by parking across the street at a meter and then making sure we moved our car in the morning. Everything was pretty close and accessible from the hotel (Bayside, South Beach, Coconut Grove etc.) Of course the downside was that the elevators were slow, depending on what time of the day it was ..but the way people complain on here, you would think it was the end of the world. It really was not that bad if you had 2-3 minutes of patience. Overall, I would stay there again because the other hotels were a little more expensive (Doubletree, Marriot) and you would have to pay even more to include breakfast. Review #22:Hotel was ideally located for the purpose of my business trip. However the Hotel has an old feel to it and the surrounding areas outside the hotel was a bit rundown and had a grimy feel. On check in the room I was assigned was very smoky smelling but they moved me to a suite with a better view. Review #23:After reading all the bad reviews I expected a real dump. That was not the case although this is not a hotel you want to book for a special occasion. The rooms are ok. Clean, quiet at night and good beds. Nothing special though. Our room had a balcony that we couldn't use because of all the construction going on. Tools and debris were lying on the balcony. The ongoing construction and the strange location of the lobby doesn't give you the feeling that you're in a 4star hotel. Tip for runners: It's a nice run from the hotel towards Miami Beach (which is only 4k away). Review #24:A few weeks ago I visited this beautiful hotel and I stayed only one night because I was taking a cruise. People was very nice to me there, specially in the front desk where I was told about all amenities. Nice room with a nice bay view. At night and in the morning service was excellent in the concierge lounge attended by Luis who did a great job. I would recommend this hotel and I would stay myself there anytime. Review #25:i stayed at this hotel for 4 nights, found the hotel clean and friendly, good bar area and resturant... I did not like the area the hotel was in i would of prefered south beach area. Although the hotel was only a taxi drive away from south beach. Overall i found this hotel to be one of the nicest hotels that i have stayed in, we flew to miami from vegas and arrived at 7.30am we were able to check in which was great staff were very helpfull. Review #26:Hotel was convenient to and from Miami airport via SuperShuttle ($16 to and from here) and to cruise ship at nearby port. I came a day before the departure of my cruise and thank goodness because my bag did not make the flight, even though I'd checked in 2 hours before the flight. As the hours wore on, I became increasingly agitated with United Airlines which could not confirm with certainty the location of my bag or when it would be delivered. I called often and continued to get unsatisfactory answers. However, finally, just before the last shuttle departure to the port, a very nice bellman at the hotel let me look around the storage room and lo and behold there was my bag (I had been previously assured that it could not be at the hotel). It could have been there 10 minutes or 10 hours, who knows--a bellman had accepted delivery and never reported it to anyone. I was so happy to have the bag and reported back to the chief concierge, Yasser, what had happened so maybe someone else wouldn't have this same mix up. He escorted me to the shuttle, heard me out, talked to the bellmen and was extremely kind. When I returned to the hotel after my cruise, I learned that I had been upgraded to a suite--yay! So even though there was a mix up with my bag which caused me some frustration and sleeplessness, the Hilton more than made up for it. This hotel deals with lots of "cruisers" and the location is so convenient next to the port --I could see my ship from my hotel window. The views of the skyline and the port are terrific. The service overall is excellent. Good amenities without a lot of nickel-and-diming, eg, free high-speed Internet with 5 or 6 terminals and connected printers. Nearby Bin 18 is a wonderful restaurant, and was recommended by the concierge (David, who was also very helpful and nice). Review #27:This was a great hotel. Stayed here during re NBA finals. The rooms are really nice and clean and the staff is amazing. Just need to watch out for all the greedy homeless people outside. Looks like the projects are just a few blocks away from the hotel and these folks come at you over and over. Never had a bum get angry and call me names because I didn't give him anything. He forgot I gave him a few dollars the day before. Also DO NOT GO TO THE RALLY'S ACROSS THE STREET. this is the worst joint ever. It tool almost 30 min to make some food an no one else was there other than the homeless people that kept asking to get their cup refilled for them. Sorry diverted from the hotel but it was perfect! ! Review #28:Booked AAA Stay and Park. Great rate for a room to accomodate 4 persons. Large room. Very comfortable beds. Fantastic view from 19th floor. Excellent service. Beautiful common areas, lounge, lobby, pool. Stayed post cruise for 1 night only. Wished we had longer to stay. Will always return to Hilton if in Miami. Only negative, which is not fault of Hilton was road construction on Biscayne blvd. Noise never a problem, just navigating the in and out of hotel slight challenge. Car rental agency at location a plus. Review #29:I spent 2 nights here for a business trip. This is an older hotel but seems to have been renovated fairly recently. One annoyance, the first suite assigned to me was already occupied! Second room was upgrade to huge corner junior suite with nice view thru floor-ceiling windows of Biscayne Bay and cruise ship harbor. Hotel was packed with south american tourists but my corner room was quiet. Location is a little awkward to enter due to road construction. 2 sets of elevators and 2nd floor lobby layout is confusing at first. High parking rates unless you get park & stay AAA rate (I did). Good restaurant. Good Chinese restaurant in Doubletree next door. Room was in good condition and seemed fairly recent renovation. Review #30:We stayed here for 2 days before our cruise out of Miami. The hotel seemed renovated and it was clean and beautiful. We had a room on the 14th floor overlooking downtown Miami. The view was amazing. The room itself was huge compared to other hotels I've stayed at. The only negative would be that they didn't come to make our beds or clean the room, but that didn't ruin our stay at the Hilton. I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a hotel close to the Miami port and I would definitely stay here again. Review #31:Stayed the night prior to our cruise, was a $15 taxi ride to the airport the next day. Reserved a king sized bed through lastminutetravel, however was not available when we arrived. The staff upgraded us to larger room, with a terrific view of the downtown and port. I would always ask for an upgrade if you dont already that that room. as a side not they had $2 beers in the bar which was quite nice Review #32:I travel to Miami on a regular basis and always stay here when the rates are competitive. It is in downtown Miami, so it makes sales calls very convenient for me. The rooms overlooking the bay have fantastic views. The food is decent, nothing great, but Bayside is just a short drive or 20 min. walk in one direction and there are more places to eat in the other direction. The pool area is nice and the water is just two blocks away. It is by no means a South Beach property (thankfully). The staff is very friendly and they always remember me. The only complaint I have is the required $28 per day for parking, but this is Miami and any decent place will charge you for parking. The valet employees are very quick and nice. Review #33:Our waitress, Angeleena, was exceptionally nice to us weary travelers, night of January 16, 2012. We wanted to get dessert to take to our room. Our room could have been better, candy wrappers in the dresser drawers and a pair on men's underwear crumpled up by the picture window. Review #34:First of all, this Hilton is OK as a hotel - rooms are all right, service is sort of all right, restaurant and bar are a bit gloomy but all right, and the location is grim but OK if you have to be away from Miami Beach for business. for the price, it's OK, nothing more. Main objection was an absolutely ludicrous bill we received for use of phone in the room - $20 USD flat rate for making a call even when it didn't connect, and about $17USD per minute for international calls. We all know hotel phones are pricey, so we kept the calls short, but even still - the rates aren't advertised anywhere in the room. Coming from Europe, it takes some time to get used to the "rip me off at every corner" culture in the States, but this was just going too far. Really abusive. So the hotel - fine, for the cost, if you have to be downtown, it's an OK choice. Phone - don't go near it. Review #35:I travel about every week for business and stay in the Hilton/Hilton chain for the points and usually my stays are fine there. This was my first and last time at the Hilton downtown Miami. Where do I start? Checking was fine and the room view was outstanding...that's the good. Valet service is god awful. There Is a dedicated attendant in a booth working but she doesn't pick up her phone...what's the point. Then when I got my car 10 minutes later the attendent just handed me my keys and walked away...a total joke. The room,...bathroom had hair on the sink and tub. The ventilation system (not the ac) was loud and could not be turned off...I am not the type that needs total silence to sleep but I was counting the days to get the he'll outta here. I was 5 rooms away from the elevator and the noise in the hall of just the elevator was annoying. I asked to change rooms and was met with attitude and a "check back later, we have no rooms left". I just smiled and went to work. You need to take an elevator to get to the registration. Then after registration you need to walk to a different set of elevators across the hotel to get to your room. A design genius put this hotel together clearly. My lesson! All Hiltons are not the same. I will be back on business in Miami soon and am damn sure I'm not staying here. Don't make the same mistake I did. Review #36:This is a very nice hotel, especially for the price. I was skeptical of the quality because of the great rates. I was pleasantly surprised. Within 5 minutes of arriving, three different employees greeted and welcomed our family . First impressions count. Huge windows with great views. Extremely comfortable beds. Two fast food restaurants across the street. Even though we booked on a discount site, we felt like important guests. Gorgeous pool. We needed extra pillows and towels - to our room in 10 minutes with a smile. This hotel should definately be rated higher. Review #37:I too saw a number of marginal comments however I stayed at the hotel in the begining of October. I was on the 8th floor. The view was inrcedible. Folks, I travel often and certainly know the difference between hiding quality service and providing quality service. If you are not the type of person who is trying to find something wrong, you will love this place. It is in downtown so you have to cab or drive to Miami beach but you know that upon reservation. I suggest the cab. It cost me 6.00 one way. 10.00 after the tip. So for 20.00 you get a safe way to and from the SOBE area. The rooms are clean and truly comfortable. The complaints you see are not accurate. Now, if you are a person who can find something wrong at any hotel than do not stay here. Because you will complain that the elevators are slow....that the elevators are warm....It will always be something and frankly you would complain if you were given the room for free. If you are complaining about anything in your room, get a life. You are in Miami. Get out and see the beach and the nitelife!!!! Overall, great place, great hotel, great staff. The total package!! ! Review #38:overall, we are very happy with this hotel. We have a great room, spectacular view. However, we have sought a bit of relaxation in the lounge both nights we have been here. Both nights the same three staff members have been on duty. They seem to have no idea how to run a bar. The service is unbelievably slow. On both nghts we have waited for 20 minutes or more for our drinks. On both nights my husband has had to get up and deliver our orders directly to the bartender. The first night our food orders took forever and tonight I never got my slice of pie and our second round of drinks never arrived. We gave up, paid for the drinks we had and retreated to our comfortable room. We go out and we travel a lot - this service was just plain bizarre. Review #39:They are doing the best they can with the old building. If low ceilings bother you this is not the place for you. This hotel is best suited for the folks who want a decent place to stay when working in downtown Miami or are going to catch a cruise. We only picked it because we wanted a hotel that would give us the night we needed for our Hilton Honors points. That having been said that have updated the rooms and the corner Jr. Suite is very spacious, had a great view of the bay but lacked a microwave or a mini-refrigerator??? The bathroom was small as well. The pool area was actually a nice surprise as it was spacious and well furnished with a very friendly full service pool bar and grill. This is a very large hotel and very busy with many international guest (we overheard many languages spoken) and eventhough the staff was VERY busy they all had a great attitude and friendly demeanor. The overwhelming number of people just means that everything takes a little longer. I also did not care for the $28/ day parking fee. Im confident that given more time I could have found something more pleasing for the second half of our family vacation. Review #40:Our stay at the Hilton Downtown Miami was nothing short of perfect. The staff were very friendly from the moment we reached there to the moment we left. I have never come across such friendly staff! We arrived there after a very long flight from Ireland and we were delighted to have such a fast check in and such friendly service. Our room was very comfortable and had a amazing view of the city and of the bay. Definitely worth the money. The breakfast buffet was quiet nice. There was one occasion in which we ordered from the menu, sadly it was a little disappointing because it was overcooked but we were taken care of almost immediately when we complained. The hotel is close to everything. All you need to do is hop on the bus or metromover which is almost outside
