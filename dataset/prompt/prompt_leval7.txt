Review #0:While planning our trip to Puerto Rico, I was shocked by how expensive most of the "nice" hotels were, even in low season (we went first week of April). This hotel lured me to book with it with its relatively lower price, nice photos, and good reviews. It turns out that the hotel IS pretty great. The front-desk staff was pleasant and helpful (we had to store our luggage with them for a day after checking out and there were no problems), the lobby was gorgeous, the breakfast was top notch (and free! ), and our room was perfect, with silky smooth bedsheets, a clean bathroom, and ample space. The only problem is when you step outside to use the pool and hottub - the swim-up bar is cute and the hamburger fare offered there is good (albeit a bit too salty), but every ten minutes it sounded like an airplane was about to crash-land on your head. I could not believe how noisy it was, and I've lived near LGA airport all my life. It was literally like the planes were landing next door (and I guess they sort of were). Fortunately, the hotel itself is well insulated, so the noise doesn't affect you at all when you're inside. If it weren't for the noisy pool, the hotel would be an easy A+ (and probably cost a lot more). As it is, I give it an A-. Review #1:My husband and I flew down to San Juan for our friends' wedding this past weekend. Since we knew we couldn't make this trip any sort of vacation, and to call it a getaway was pushing it, we wanted to stay somewhere clean, comfortable and efficient. We got that and so much more! The location was perfect. It's right across the street from the El San Juan hotel (site of the wedding), a Walgreens and Lupi's, a Mexican restaurant recommended to us (it did not disappoint). Plus, the value is the best I've seen in a long time. There's the free breakfast (not gourmet or cooked to order, but there were plenty of options and everything tasted good), the lovely pool area with swim-up bar and grill with burgers so juicy they rival those at In-N-Out and Five Guys, the comfy bed, the flatscreen TV with all the channels of home as well as a plethora of Spanish-speaking ones, the business center and the efficiency of check-in and check-out that could not be beat. Obviously it's not the best choice if you want a luxurious, long-term vacation. This is because it's not on the beach (but it's a block away), and if you want a poolside cocktail, you need to get up and get it yourself rather than have a waiter bring it to you. But I'd recommend this hotel to folks who either are in town briefly for an event or who need a place to stay before or after a cruise. Although, I must say we're tempted to stay here even for a full-on vacation after reading the horrible reviews about the cleanliness and service at the El San Juan hotel. The El San Juan is THE place to be for dancing and partying (and weddings -- the wedding we attending was fabulous), no doubt, but even we noticed dirty couches and an overall indifference of the staff when it came to actually doing their jobs. Review #2:I stayed with my bf. The bedroom is big & clean, the bed is super comfortable & king size, have a very good size TV, the bathroom was ok, but the bathtub was a bit small. The beach is 5 minute walk & you can find various fast foods near the place so you dont have to waste money. Overall, I had a lovely, fun & romantic experience. Can't wait to go back. HIGHLY RECOMENDED! Review #3:We just needed a place to stay for one night between getting back from Vieques and flying out of San Juan. This was a great place for that. The room was lovely and was air conditioned and had a TV with cable, which was nice after being in various locations around PR for 10 days. It was more of a suite than a room, with a living room area with a wet bar and then a separate room that was a bedroom. Both rooms had tvs. It was very close to the airport and the breakfast was nice and included with the room. We would definitely stay here again to be close to the airport, though if this is the only place you stay in PR, you are missing the best part. Review #4:This hotel was very nice and clean and the staff was very nice. However, the Isla Verde area is quite dumpy and I felt nervous walking around it. Also, the airplanes are way too loud and ruin the atmosphere. I was with my sister and our children and we were hit on more than once by some shady looking guys which made me really uncomfortable with our young children around. The beach in Isla Verde was dirty and stinky. We didn't even get wet. We stayed at this hotel because we had an early morning flight. I would only recommend staying there if you need to be close to the airport. We also stayed 4 days at the Carbie Hilton, which was very nice. If they could move the hotel to a nice part of town, I'd stay there again. Review #5:One of our better choices without breaking our budget . Clean and modern facility which even included breakfasts. We would have a quick breakfast and be gone all day seeing the island. Often didn't return to our room till late at night and were never disapponted with the hotel. Great facilty for familes - kids always were in the pool having fun. Review #6:This is a very nice hotel, We love ti, is very private, Front Desk all the agents there are very nice and friendly specially Dianna, she's always wealling to help. Housekeeping is excellent! Maintenance is great! this hotel is very clean, smells good, the pool is very confortable, the rooms are very nice, very clean and the beds are awesome! This hotel is very nice, confortable and customer service is great! Review #7:We stayed at Hampton Inn for one night pre-cruise. It was a quick 10 minute ride from the airport and about 20 minute drive to the Pan Am cruise pier. The morning of checkout we found an employee outside who was helping guests get cabs and we had no trouble finding one immediately. The rooms were quiet, in spite of the proximity to the airport. There are many restaurants within walking distance. We walked across the street and were on a beautiful beach within just a few minutes, where we enjoyed pleasant walk, then into the casino of the El San Juan Hotel for a little gambling in their casino. Then into the pool and hot tub for more evening relaxation. The Hampton staff could not have been more friendly and helpful! When we asked a question, they would respond and always add "...is there anything else I can do for you?" The breakfast buffet was excellent and plentiful, with lots of seating area and tables for everyone. Hampton exceeded my expectations and I would definitely stay there in the future. Review #8:Have stayed at this hotel twice pre cruise and loved it. The hotel staff are very friendly and helpful. Rooms a clean and comfortable. Location is very good 5 minutes from airport and a short walk to the beach. We find this hotel to be the best value for your dollar and have it booked again this year pre and post cruise, which we are very much looking forward to. Review #9:We were here for one night post cruise just to relax and we were delighted with the service and amenities. Wireless internet is a plus after being without for a week. The rooms were spacious and comfortable. The location was decent just a two block walk to the beach and the main street. The beach was very nice. Would stay here again especially for the price booked with hotwire. Review #10:This is a fine location for a quick stopover in San Juan. The clean, nicely furnished hotel is in the Isla Verde tourist district immediately adjacent to the airport, close to several casinos and numerous eateries. People sensitive to noise should try to avoid rooms in Tower A, which is closest to the airport runways and immediately next to a cock fighting arena whose combatants greet the dawn collectively. Review #11:This is a great place to stay. Although there is airplane noise out at the pool, it was rarely heard inside. The staff is friendly and very helpful. The breakfast is great. The pool is wonderful and well kept. There are lots of good restaurants at the big hotels nearby but be prepared..they are pricey! all in all, we really enjoyed our stay here!! ! Review #12:Prior to going to this hotel I did read a negative review about bedbugs; and the first thing I did when I got into the room was check for them--nothing! But what I will say is this, the hotel was very clean, the staff was very friendly and helpful; and the breakfast was excellent. Each morning we were up at 6 am, and at breakfast by 7:30 am. ; it was empty, quiet, and a pleasure. I grew up with parents who always left the hotel maid a tip, and I am no different, but I was really surprised that my maid, (her name is Blanca) did not take my tip; and I was curious why? Unfortunately, she didn't work on the weekends! Walgreens is right across the street, and also on that side of the street you can keep straight, veer off to your left, and you are on the beach. Its a beautiful beach, and is great for early morning risers and rising sun seekers. Loved it, and its really less than a 5 minute walk, at best. We also rented a car with Alamo, and the hotel charged only $5 a day for parking. Overall, it was a good hotel to stay at. Review #13:I took my two college age kids for a Chrismtas vacation and this hotel was very adequate and priced great. The beach is a few blocks away and there area ton of shops and restaurants close as well as a supermarket a few blocks away. It was a very safe area and i would recommend if you have a tight budget to stay here. Review #14:I think this is the nicest Hampton Inn we have stayed at. We paid in the mid 250s because everything was booked Presidents's Day weekend, but we were totally pleased with the hotel. I had previously stayed at the Hilton Caribe and really liked that - its a better location for getting to Old Town - but the Hampton is opposite the street from the Ritz and other hotels, allowing more access to restaurants, casinos, etc. The hotel is very clean (far more so than the four star El Conquistador Resort, for example!) and the beds are as good as the best Westin beds. The breakfast is an actual hot breakfast, plus so many other choices of cereals, juices, breads, and bagels, fruit, yogurt, granola, etc. - better than most Hampton Inns. The rooms were quite, the pool looked nice (we did not use) and the staff were helpful. I highly recommend this hotel over many four star establishments in Puerto Rico! Review #15:We just came back from beautiful San Juan and I have to tell you guys the hotel was almost perfect...buffet breakfast,reasonable price,kind and charming staff,pleasant pull (little bit dirty though ) good location...but....bed bugs!!!! I can't stop scratching my self!! So now you know, and I believe not every bed is infected ,but mine was...:( and yes internet was impossible to use cause it was too slow. Review #16:We stayed at the Hamtpon Inn & Suites for spring break and had a wonderful experience! It's a great hotel for the price, not to mention in a good location. The staff was very nice and offered lots of suggestions for places to eat and have fun; they also had answers to all our questions. The Business Center with free internet and printing was a nice surprise, and there was also wireless in the room. The hotel overall is well-kept and clean and the beds are small but comfortable. When I go back to Puerto Rico, I will definitely book at the Hampton Inn! Review #17:We got stuck in San Juan after being bumped off our flights all day long. We fly stand by, so we're not eligible to have our hotel paid for by the airline. We had just spent 4 days at the Embassy Suites Dorado del Mar, and had been at the airport since 5 AM. The last flight left at 7:45 PM without us on it and so we called around to find a hotel. We got to the Hampton Inn & Suites around 9 PM. We were exhausted. Since we are a family of 5, a room with 2 beds doesn't accomodate us. After explaning our situation with being stranded and having sat with 3 kids at the airport all day, I asked for a roll away and was told it was going to be another $20 or we could switch the room type and have a pull out couch for an additonal $40. The room rate was already pretty steep. Our rate for a suite at the Embassy Suites in Dorado which included 2 beds and a pull out couch on a beautiful resort property was less before these additonal charges even! We declined both and took the standard (overpriced) room. Our teenager slept on the floor. The room was nice, but a little worn. The walls had scuff marks on them everywhere and the furniture is pretty banged up. Also, the room is pretty cramped. The pool and the pool bar were right out side of our window, so it was a little noisy. We went back downstairs and asked if there was anywhere to eat. The front desk employees were friendly and helpful and gave us a lot of options of places we could walk to for dinner. We returned and went to sleep and checked out the next morning at 5 AM. This hotel is nice, but definitely overpriced. Review #18:We stayed at this hotel for one night. We booked through travelocity. We were delayed one night and travelocity said the hotel would not refund us our money for the night, so oh well, live and learn. The front desk staff were helpful and friendly. The room itself was pretty clean except for some black marks on the walls. I didn't complain because I was so exhausted from sleeping at the (ATL)airport the night before. I would stay here again for one night but if I was planning a longer stay in San Juan, I would pay the extra money for a four or five star resort. Review #19:This hotel has to be a sleeper. We have stayed in San Juan on 4 previous occasions over the past 10 years prior to cruising and this is by far and away the best hotel we have experienced. Not only is it less expensive than where we stayed in the past, the rooms (suites?) are larger - about 500 sq ft if you choose a poolview room - the entire hotel is spotless, it's within walking distance from many restaurants, other hotels, car rental agencies, and the beach which incidentally we don't think is that good. The modest comp breakfast satisfies, the burgers at the pool bar are super and the airport noise is a non issue in the rooms due to excellent double paned windows. Forget the over pricing at the hotels with casinos on the beach, you can walk to 3 of them from the Hampton and it's more comfortable. Review #20:We stayed at this place for 2 days...really a nice place to stay and is very near to airport aswell Old san Juan...checked in real quick..and the receptionist was very helpful in giving the maps and directions to Old San Juan...there was WIFI in the room...room service was good ..the only issue was the noise from the AC was not sure was this the problem with all the rooms or only with that of ours..:( and served the continental breakfast.The area nearby was gud for wandering..all together a nice place to stay... Review #21:We stayed here last Sunday for one overnight after disembarking from a 7 day cruise. This was our second stay here and it met our needs perfectly. We arrived at the hotel at about 8:30am and no surprise, there was no room ready for us. That was okay because we then took a ride (we rented a car from Avis after getting off the ship) to El Yunque rain forest and explored for a couple of hours. When we returned, the room was ready and we hung out at the pool for a while. We did plan to take advantage of the poolside grill for dinner, but when I walked up and ordered two burgers I was told that it would be at least an hour wait. Hmmm...we went to plan "B" and walked down to the beach/pier and went to a nice little restaurant instead - "La Playita." Our flight home was at 10:30am Monday so we had a leisurely morning to finish packing and have breakfast before the 5 minute ride to the airport. We had none of the problems listed in some of the prior reviews. I did not give it 5 stars because it is not a 5 star hotel. It's clean with a friendly staff and typical Hampton Inn amenities. We paid $190 US for this night. Staying that one extra night saved us about $400 on airfare, and twist my arm, I had to stay in Puerto Rico for one more night. It was a great addition to a wonderful vacation week. Review #22:Although this hotel costs more than I usually pay for Hampton, it is worth it. It is modern and clean as a pin. The location is excellent. It is a few steps from the beach and near many restaurants. The rooms have large flat screen tvs with adequate cable. There is free wifi and wired internet. They have a good breakfast with some hot items changing daily. What really makes this place special is the people running it. Although there is no conscierge, the front desk fills in admirably. They are anxious to make your stay pleasant and productive. Review #23:Perfect stop pre-approved by the flight crews! Stayed one night, Oct 6. Arrived early enough to enjoy the clean pool and tasty poolside grilled lunch of cheeseburgers and fries prepared to perfection, a bargain at $8. No South Beach diet, but we were on vacation. True, during the day the jets landing on the adjacent runway will momentarily shake your bones, but they don't fly at night. Took a cab to the fabulous (by any standard) Plaza las Americas Mall for the highest quality shops we've seen anywhere in the continental U.S., with better prices, too. The Hampton Inn rooms are spacious, safe and clean with very comfortable beds and all bedclothes are washed daily. Windows are double-paned to reduce noise, but I would request a room on the left wing as you face Reception farther from the runways if you want to nap during the day. Really, at night the noise is not a problem. The airlines would not put their crews there unless it was clean, safe and quiet and a good price close to the airport. Also, 2 blocks away is a fabulous, free, white powder sand beach with gentle waves, possibly the best beach we've ever enjoyed. This place could be a destination unto itself. Lots of good restaurants within safe walking distance. Prefer this to Old San Juan any day. Review #24:I have had several extended trips to San Juan this year, and I will only stay at the Hampton Inn & Suites on busy Isla Verde Avenue. It is close to the airport, where I was working, but also close to the beach and several restaurants, all within walking distance. There are also several other shops nearby for the everyday conveniences. Most nights I didn't even leave the hotel since there is a poolside bar and grill outside. Even though I was there on business, my evenings felt like a vacation. This hotel has all the Hampton Inn conveniences while maintaining the lad back Caribbean vibe. Review #25:Nice and clean, friendly staff, beautiful decor with a tropical theme through out the place. Pool was abit small and loud from the planes, but we wanted to be near the airport. The poolside bar and grill was fantastic thier burgers were nice and juicy with lots of flavor- only 6.50$( came with a side dish) No problems getting a reasonable cab to the airport. A short walk away you can go to the beach. Review #26:We had decided that we wanted to stay an extra night in Puerto Rico to visit more of the island after we completed our Carribean cruise. We found this hotel through hotels.com and carefully read the reviews before we left. Since the overall rating was good, we decided to book. And we were happy to see that we had made the right pick. Check in was fairly quick even though there was a long line-up upon arrival. Parking cost less than $6 tax in for guests.The room was beautifully furnished with top notch furniture and comfortable bedding. The business center had three computers with complimentary internet access (very slow though at times). Complimentary breakfast offered waffles, eggs, sausage, all types of breads, coffee cakes, cereals, fresh fruit, orange juice, and good coffee. Everything was delicious except for the sausage which looked really dry and not too apetizing. Great location, 5 minutes walk from beach and about 15 minutes from airport. Hotel has a beautiful jacuzzi and outdoor pool with pool bar. Pool towels are provided even when we went to the beach. The pool bar also prepared barbecued food and we absolutely LOVED their baby-back ribs made by Jay. Remember that name, cause he is the guy you want behind the grill and who will make the difference in your appreciation of this meal. He is such a pro at this and trust me you won't eat any other ones like these! Chicken burger was also very tasty and juicy as well as their hamburgers. Salad side dish was not very generous, so we ommitted the chips and asked for more greens, which they happily did. Drinks are very cheap. We stayed at a different hotel when we arrived in Puerto Rico the day before our cruise and we were very disappointed, even though the cost was very comparable. So this one is definitely a keeper! Review #27:Clean rooms, wonderful front desk staff, great breakfast buffets. I had one small problem with my phone and one of the maintenance personnel overhead my comment. Next thing I know, he's upstairs fixing the phone! What service! Very personable staff - always friendly and polite. I can't say enough about them. The Tuesday night buffets are okay - get there early because the food does run out! The food by the pool area is good. As with everything in Puerto Rico, make sure you allow plenty of time - it's definitely NOT fast food! Close to the airport, but you can't hear the noise unless you're by the pool. You really can't go wrong here! Review #28:My wife and I went on a cruise and stayed at the Hampton Inn for a few days beforehand so we could see San Juan. The inside of the hotel, especially the rooms, are beautiful. It is a nice looking place and service was good. The breakfast was so-so, not bad, but definitely not great either. My primary reservation with the hotel was the price: 1) Nothing says class like a cock fighting arena outside your window. 2) Going to the beach is a 10 minute walk and once you get there, it is not automatic that you will find a beach chair. 3) A taxi to Old San Juan is $20 each way. We took the public bus for $0.75 each, but it took roughly 50 minutes each way. 4) When at the pool, you could almost feel the wind from the jet engines. None of these are deal-breakers, but I thought the price of $200 a night was a little high (it felt like a $120 hotel). I talked with someone in a nearby restaurant who was at the Courtyard about 5 minutes away, and he paid $20 less a night and was on the beach. If I did this again, I think I would definitely try this next. Review #29:I stayed here for three nights, April 20th to 23rd, 2010. I stayed in room # 333. I paid $ 135 USD per night. This hotel belongs to the Hilton family of hotels. I really enjoyed my stay. My room was a one King bed room. Great bed, clean linen. The room was very clean. I had free WiFi internet in the room. Free breakfast was included in the price. I have read that other guest's paid $ 5 USD for parking. I had a rental car, and, the front desk always validated my parking ticket, everytime I wanted to depart the hotel. I don't think the front desk makes this function known, and, those other guest's probably never asked. The palapa bar out by the swimming pool, is a great place to un-wind every night. They do grill up some nice meals there for you, along with refreshing drinks. The only planes I ever heard taking off or landing, was when I was out at the palapa bar. When in my room, I never heard any jet noises at all. I definately recommend this hotel to everybody. On my future visits to Puerto Rico, I will be booking this hotel again. Review #30:Room is good. (King suite facing pool). Average condition, few amenities (no bar, restaurant, etc...except pool bar w/food outside). Quiet...except for some airport noise and loud voices from adjoining room through closed doors. Typical free Hampton breakfast buffet. However, lousy neighborhood. Run down, dirty streets and buildings. Nearby beach is dirty with piles of sea weed. Next time I would pay the extra for Condado area resort hotel or stay in Old San Juan. It's $50 round trip cab, incl tip to Old San Juan, where all the city's character is. Spend a day touring Old San Juan, impressive castles/forts, neat streets and shops. $19 plus tip to Pan American cruise ship dock from this hotel. Review #31:My wife and I spent a long weekend in Puerto Rico to visit with our son who had been working here for the last several months and to get a break from the cold. We chose the Hampton Inn after reading the reviews here. I have to say that this hotel exceeded my expectations. The rooms were clean and comfortable. The breakfast in the lobby each morning was just right, it saved time and money. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful. I don't know if I would recommend this someone who was looking for more of a resort stay. I think if you came to Puerto Rico and only stayed in the vicinity of the hotel, you would miss a lot of the charm and beauty of the island. We used this as a base to operate from and traveled all over the island. There is a lot at the hotel though; Walgreen's across the street and several restaurants in walking distance. A two block walk to the beach was not a problem. When we went to that beach I noticed a resort with umbrellas and lounge chairs approximately 100 yards from where we set up our towels. I walked over to get a better look and discovered that it was the Ritz-Carlton. I'm certain that none of the people there paid $179 a night to get to that beach. The pool, hot tub and swim up bar at the hotel were great. You could spend your vacation there and have a great time. On Monday we took the 75 cent bus trip to Old San Juan and explored. The desk clerk gave us excellent advise on which bus to take and also told us to take the free trolley to the farthest point out once we arrived at the bus station. That way we could work our way back through the city going downhill. That worked out great. I would definitely stay at this hotel again. Review #32:We stayed here for just one night after a late arrival into San Juan. The cab ride from the airport to the hotel was $12-$15. The room was a little small for a Hampton Inn, but still very comfy. We had enough room with our baby's travel crib to use the desk and lounge chair all at the same time. Very comfy bed, great water pressure, & nice continental breakfast. The pool area with bar looked really nice, but we didn't stay long enough to try it. The price was reasonable compared to the other options in the area. Review #33:Stayed here mid Nov and loved it. The outside pool bar has great. The food is outstanding and the drinks were reasonably priced. Room was clean and quiet. Great location walk to beach, walgreens, restaurants. Safe neighborhood. Hotel parking $10 a night Review #34:We have stayed at the Hampton Inn a few times before, and it was always only for a night or two before a cruise. The hotel is nice, but I wouldn't want to stay for longer than a few nights, seeing as there's not a ton to do. The location is pretty good, there are some nice restaurants and a beach nearby. The pool is good. You can get food, like burgers and grilled cheese, from the bar near the pool. There's a hot tub too and lots of chairs to sit on. The rooms are pretty good. They have a good amount of space, we could fit our whole family of five in one room, which had two queen beds and we had a rollaway as well. The first time we stayed here we had a nice view of the pool, the second time we had an ugly view of the parking lot, but we didn't mind much. Breakfast is great. It's free and a buffet is set up so you can get your breakfast in the lobby. They have coffee, cereal and fruit as well as some hot food like sausage and eggs, as well as toast. For other meals you have to eat at the bar by the pool or go to a nearby restaurant. The location was good here, because it was just a short walk to the beach and many restaurants, however it was very close to the airport as well, which is both good and bad. Good because it doesn't take long to get to the hotel, but bad because there are always planes passing by so it's quite noisy. I would recommend this hotel if you need somewhere to stay for a short amount of time before a cruise, or if you don't plan to do much on your vacation. Review #35:Stayed here in March, 2006 The Good: Overall itâ€™s a nice hotel, although its far from a new property. The breakfast ins included and they do a nice job- choice of coffees and tea, fruit, a hot item, cereals, yogurt etc. The business center is a nice plus and offers free printing. The pool is on the small side- but never looked crowded. The people are friendly The not so good: The hotel has suites and standard rooms- I was in a standard room. The furniture is newer, but the rooms themselves are kind of beat up ( some mildew on the over calked bath tub, â€œblackâ€� material coming from the piper in the tub, etc.). The hotel is very close to the airport and if you have the windows open you feel like you are sleeping on a run way. As with most Hamptons â€“ this location offers no room service or restaurant- there is however a snack area at the pool- but it closes fairly early. Summary- stay there if the price is right but compare the Marriott Price and Availability first Review #36:I've stayed at dozens of properties throughout the Hilton family, ranging from high-end Waldorf Astoria properties in New York or the Conrad in the Maldives, to not-so-stellar places such as airport Hampton Inns. Because this property was so close to San Juan airport, I was assuming it'd be like your typical airport budget hotel...but was surprised and delighted to see it was not. This property is great --good location, great staff, and nice interiors/rooms --definitely the best Hampton Inn I've stayed at.... and generally nicer than more than 70% of Hilton Hotels I've stayed at. The lobby featured new/modern decor...as did the room. The bed/furnishings were high quality....and the materials in the bathroom (granites and beautiful tile) were too. The room was quiet and very clean --I remarked at how "fresh" the room smelled when I first walked in. They provided the typical Hampton Inn breakfast, which included fruits, cereals, carbs, and some hot options which included cheese omelets, bacon, and make-your-own waffles. There was plenty of self-dispensed juice to drink too in addition to coffee. You can eat at table seating, bartop seating, or outdoors by the pool. The pool was nice --large and clean, and featured a swim-up bar to a bar/grill in the rear of the property. The food at the pool bar/grill was top-notch; I was shocked I was eating in a Hampton Inn and shocked I was eating at a pool bar/grill with the type of quality I was enjoying. Bar/grill staff were very friendly. Front desk staff was cheery and helpful. There was an error on my folio at check-out that they promptly fixed. The location is good; a short 2-3 minute walk across the street brings you to the Ritz Carlton, other nearby casinos, or the beach. I felt safe in and around the hotel. Overall, a great stay in a great property with great service. So much so the hotel should bear a more upscale brand than "Hampton Inn." Review #37:I travel to PR several times a year and always stay at the Hampton Inn in Isla Verde. I always have a wonderful experience - the staff are very friendly and helpful (will always point you to a great restaurant or book a local tour), the rooms are large and clean, and the location is excellent. You have a short walk to the beach, a ton of restaurants, and bars. There are several other large hotels nearby (on the beach) that are extremely overpriced and stuffy. I have stayed in a variety of these hotels as well and always have a poor experience. I highly recommend the Hampton Inn! Review #38:The staff are very friendly and accommodating. The whole hotel is clean and pleasant to be in. Parking is an extra $5 a day but that us fair compared to other locations in the area. Breakfast is included but if your kids like cereal ask for it. For those who keep kosher, Chabad is a five minute walk from the hotel. Review #39:Just returned from a quick trip to PR with mom to celebrate her 60th. Love the place and the people. We took a jr. suite facing the pool. We had 2 double cloud 9 beds and a large tv in the bedroom. A nice kitchen area with sink, coffee maker, microwave, and mini frig. We also had a living room with couch, chair, desk/table with 2 side chairs and a large tv. All was clean and very nice. Continental breakfasts w/ 2 ho
