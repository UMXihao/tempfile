Review #0:I was afraid to stay in this hotel after reading the other reviews, but it was most conveniently located to the company I was visiting so I didn't switch. I was pleasantly surprised to find a newly renovated room. The bed had a pillow-top, fitted sheets that stayed put during the night, and comfortable pillows. The bathroom was quite nice, with marble countertop, a full sized hair dryer, and several small shelves to keep my toiletries. The one strange thing was the lack of a bathroom door, but the front desk assured me that this is temporary and due to the recent renovations (the doors were delayed in being delivered), and only single travelers are given rooms without a bathroom door. I had a problem with my thermostat the first night and it was fixed quickly. I only ate breakfast in the restaurant, and found it adequate. Review #1:Conference I was attending and presenting at was based here, so I made a reservation directly with the hotel. Not cheap but not outlandish - very straightforward. . Incredibly central, convenient location at the X'ing of two of Toronto's major avenues and subway lines. Land is dear, which explains why the reception, bar and breakfast restaurant are the only hotel spaces on the ground floor (adjoining the subway station) and the "1st Floor" is 6 flights above. My room had a dreary view of internal "garden" (i.e., an outdoor smoking space). . Check-in was adequate. I had a minor problem with my room service sandwich (missed the deadline to get "a real meal") which was fixed. The conference food that was served was above average. Room fixtures, upkeep and the housekeeping were outstanding. Note that unlike in the states, many of the Marriott rooms and spaces in this hotel were "smoking" - yuck. Still, my non-smoking room was ok. Bed was fantastic. Lighting was good. Bathroom excellent. . While Marriott quality was present and the service was good, nothing about this hotel (except its location at the Bloor and Young St. intersection) blew me away. I would stay here again, but I wouldn't go out of my way. Review #2:In needed a nice hote lto stay at in the downtown Toronto area, while visiting friends. I usually prefer Marriott as they have always been a trusted hotel, that exceeds the service I look for in a hotel. The hotel is situated in a nice area in the Yorkville subdivision right off of Bloor Street. You have the fine shopping at your finger tips right up the street, which was beyond convenient. The Eaton Centre, CN Tower, and all the nice major attractions are all within distance, which made this hotel very suitable for me. When entering upon the hotel, the staff was nothing but friendly and inviting awaiting to assist you. The lobby had been renovated not too long ago, and looked rather lovely as did the guest rooms. The beds were super relaxing and comfortable and provided a good nights rest during my entire stay. I did have the opportunity to see how their room service was, and everything was perfect. The restaurant Matissa in the Hotel was priced a pinch cheaper then the hotels room service, as the food was delicious. I went there almost daily for a bowl of the soup of the day. Cannot wait for my return back to Toronto to visit my friends, as I will be making this officially hotel of choice each time I visit. Review #3:My Spanish friend and I stayed in this hotel for two nights (Aug. 14 and 15, 2011). It's the first time that my friend came to Canada. She couldn't speak English and my spoken English is so so. We were very impressed with the excellent services this hotel provided. A couple of examples, We were not familiar to Toronto at all. We wanted to take the subway. After we asked a lady working in the lobby of the main entrance that hotel, she was so nice to accompany us to the subway station connected to the hotel. Farahna, a very nice girl who was working in the front desk of that hotel, was so kind to provide all the info about the "City tour" we were interested in and booked it for us. Even a very nice man working in the housekeeping department of the hotel did help me a lot when I saw him in the hallway of the floor and asked him a few questions about Toronto. Itâ€™s hard for a tourist in a city like Toronto that he or she is not familiar with at all. A help, even if itâ€™s a trivial one, can make a big difference. My friend and I had a wonderful time and unforgettable memory about the hotel. We will come back and would like to recommend it to our friends and relatives. Thanks a lot. Qiong Dai Review #4:Literally above the metro and right on Bloor (the Bond street of Toronto) the location is very good. The bed is very comfy and massive, room is nice but nothing special. Restaurant had great service but only average food. Get the internet and breakfast included for about 4 bucks, well worth it. A good place if you're not going to be spending much time there, or to hold a convention at. Review #5:This is not my first visit to the Marriott Bloor Yorkville. The location of the hotel is why I have selected it in past and why I selected it again this time. I'm not sure that I was expecting a lot of change in the hotel and I wasn't disappointed -- nothing has changed since my last stay three years ago. The price is good; the location is what I wanted; the rooms are large and well appointed. However, given everything, I can only give the hotel an Average. Here's why: The internet is only free in the lobby. I still can't understand why hotels do not have free internet -- build it into the cost of the room. Towel are a three on a scale of five. Not thread-bare but not fluffy either. Bed is fairly comfortable but not pillow-topped mattress. Again, just a three. I had such a bad experience with breakfast the last time I stayed at this Marriott, I didn't even give it a chance this time. Thus, no "scrambled egg" test. I walked over to Flo's Diner for breakfast. Water pressure in the shower is "just OK". Having said all of this, I probably will stay here again. But, I sure wish they would change their policy on internet availability. Review #6:I have been staying at this hotel almost weekly since August of 2011 and have never been disappointed. The hotel staff, especially the front desk and Consignerâ€™s Lounge staff, provides timely and effective service. The staff is always pleasant and more than willing to help. The Hotel itself is clean and reasonably well kept. The subway is available directly underground to the hotel as is a shopping plaza complete with food court. There a several excellent restaurants within walking distance and for those adventurous souls Yonge St is just around the corner. Review #7:There is one main reason you choose this hotel: location. It is located at the junction of the Yonge and Bloor subway lines and is also right on the PATH. But despite this central location, it was still a ride to go to any of the attractions or evening hotspots. The rooms were decent, the staff was courteous, but nothing out of the ordinary. While there is nothing specific that would make me rate this hotel negatively, for business or tourists, I would recommend staying closer to Eaton Centre or Union Station. If you're in the suburbs and still want subway access, consider North York. For the price, this hotel is only passable. Review #8:Stayed here in a suite for 3 nights from August 10. Shortly after arriving early evening the fire alarm went off meaning we had to walk down 10 floors to reception and wait until given the all clear after the Toronto Fire Dept had inspected and found nothing. The following late afternoon, the same thing happened. On Friday morning there was a power cut which lasted from 0730hrs until sometime after 1145hrs (when we left the hotel for the day having had to use the bathroom by torchlight to get ready for the day). Again, we had to walk down 10 floors to exit the hotel. On Saturday morning, whilst preparing to check out, the fire alarm went off again at approximately 1100hrs. The building was evacuated, the Toronto Fire Dept turned up and again the all clear was given some time later. When we raised these issues with the manager, we were told that people had been smoking in the stairwell and therefore they were not false alarms and we were offered 5,000 Marriott points and the extra charge for our kid's rollaway bed was removed from the bill! Not good enough Marriott...this hotel is a disgrace to the brand and you need to do better. Secondary to this: the room was fine, housekeeping was good (and their job was made especially difficult by the constant disruption) but could not be sure as to the true nature of the view out towards Bloor as the windows were so filthy. Would not stay here again and do not recommend for reasons above. Review #9:my girlfriend and I stayed down here on the Friday of thanksgiving weekend after getting a great price on line last minute . We checked in at 7 pm very quickly and very politley by the check in desk. went into our room and showered. The bathroom was a bit small but very nicley decorated and very clean. left for the night and came back after midnight to go to bed. The bed was a king and was soft and comfortable and there was no noise to be heard in the halls or other rooms. woke up at 10 am and checked out at 10:45. The hotel has no ppol which was a disappointment but had a very well equipped gym. This is an excellent hotel if you are looking for a very nice room, comfy bed, and just a place to leave your suitcase if you can get it for a good price but not recommended for families trying to keep kids entertained . great location though for shopping and sight seeing as its connected right to the TTC Subway Review #10:I reserved this hotel with Priceline at a fantasitic rate, so when I received it, I had some hestitation as I had read some rather bad past reviews of this property. Plus as a Priceline customer, I assumed I would be getting a less desireable room. Well I was wrong. Check had a slight wait. I was given a room on the VIP floor. The room was a king non-smoking. The bed was the most comfortable I have ever slept in. It was very clean and fresh. Amenities included a robe, coffee and tea and high quality shampoos and soaps. Some people may have complained about the walk from the elevator. Yes, it was quite far, but if you are able to walk, I don't see a problem. A little exercise wouldn't hurt. Another big plus is the 1PM check out. The location is perfect. Right above underground shopping and subway. Parking is available for $15.00 a day, but I used the one across the street as the hotel's do not have in-out privileges. But if you are just going to be downtown, leave the car and walk or use the subway. I was ready to give this hotel 5 stars. I had put washed some clothes and when I went down to get them, my key card would not work. I called the front desk and they said they would send someone up. I waited 15 minutes, called again and they again said someone would be right up. A guest opened the door for me. When I got my clothes, I found the card would not work in the room. I found out at 1PM, the cards are de-activated. I am not sure if it is all rooms or just "Priceline rooms". I think some hotels do this, if they do it is not in their best interest to satisfy guests. Given the small problem, I would recommend this hotel Review #11:Stayed on business and would not hesitate to recommend this hotel. King bed was extremely comfortable with a selection of both soft and hard pillows. Room was spacious and immaculate, staff was always helpful with directions and service. Room service was very prompt. Also extremely important, the location is very central (Bloor & Yonge), subway is right downstairs, as well as a small mall. This hotel is walking distance to shopping, restaurants, and there is a grocery store right next door. Review #12:While staying in this hotel someone broke into our room wile my boyfriend and I were sleeping and stole all of our money and credit cards. I am assuming it had to have been an inside job and that they were a professional pickpocket because we did not hear them. The hotel did nothing to help us except for a complimentary breakfast. The hotel proved to be completely unconcerned that this could happen to one of their customers while staying in one of their hotels. I will never stay in a Marriott hotel again. I strongly advise to look elsewhere for a hotel when staying in Toronto. I can not go back in time and change what happened to me but hopefully I can help make sure that this does not happen to someone else Review #13:Most important note: Unless you are only staying in Toronto, get a hotel OUTSIDE the city. The parking fee is extremely high (some underground garage). It's almost 30 dollars. Spaces are all tight and limited. People were nice. Location was good. Right above the underground mall area. Room was kind of far, was a trek to get there. The rooms were pretty fair though. It's what you would expect. Some burnt out bulbs. A little dusty on the shelves and such. Good place to stay, but if you are renting/bringing a car, rent outside the city and drive in because you are going to get killed with parking fees. I think it's only worth it here if you plan on not having a car. Review #14:You can't beat the super convenience of this Bloor Yorkville property. Right next door is an extensive indoor walkways that connect to the entire Bloor Yorkville area. In winter months, we really appreciated the warm walkways lined with food, shops and service outlets.Grab a coffee and doughnut on the go, drop off some laundry, top up your phone plan, get a massage, send flowers? Right there! The best is that the entrance of Marriott is 30 paces from one of the Bloor Yonge subway entrances. bingo, you go everywhere on the TTC system. With all these, we could put up a bit with the less than luxurious decor: the room is large sized, the gym outstanding and yes, even Matisse, the breakfast place downstairs is pretty good for a catchup place for coffee with friends. Review #15:Hotel rooms start at 6th floor. Expensive weekday hotel parking down in Basement levels which is actually above ground garage levels on top of street level Bays shopping mall. Weekend hotel parking is CN$25 per day, weekday at 40. Downstairs ground level Bays Shopping mall have 2 food courts, but was closed every time we were looking for dinner. Quite expensive restaurants at within this block west areas along Yonge Street. More reasonably price restaurants are on the east side along Mount Pleasant Road areas. Subway station entrances are beneath the shopping mall. Downstairs garage levels on top of the Bay shopping mall is under construction. Loud jack hammer going all day till 5pm including Saturday. No warning on web site. Only told customers at check in, kept saying it is not their fault. Avoid turning right existing garage, Bloor street is dug up for extensive construction. Massive grid lock. Got 5 rooms at good prices at Priceline.com for weekend. Avoid rooms near elevators (room with low numbers) because of elevator cable knocking noises. Excellent room furnishing. Large LCD flat screen TV, but only typical few hotel channels, and shown in lowest composite NTSC resolution, what a shame. No mini-refrigerators or mini-bar or microwave. Hate shower without flow volume control â€“ only one setting in full blast and waste of water â€“ stupidest American invention. Mini-safe and coffer maker. Stiff sheets. One type of blanket in dawn feather. Tough for Californians unable to overnight adjust to this. Can only sleep next night by cooling the room down below 60. Competent staff at registration. Room internet charge $13.60 per day. But free wifi at lobby, what a hassle, I guess encourage hotel elite rating. Breakfast buffet at $17.50. Good fitness. Business center allow free printing of airline boarding pass. Review #16:Very typical hotel, nothing special. Rooms are good size, yet mediocre in design & amenities. Circular floor layout, make for a long walk to some rooms. I stayed for a week for a business trip, we hosted our annual Sales Meeting here. The meeting rooms were nice, the service was excellent - the business concierge, the av team, the food services; would definitely recommend for business activities. The front desk and restaurant/bar were kind but to the point. A big complaint...twice during my 6 night stay we were awoken by the fire alarm and evacuation. Come to find out it was the Bunsen burners being used by the hotel staff to heat breakfast in the 4th floor corridor for another meeting. No explanations, no apologies - NOT good customer service. Review #17:Yet another Priceline shopper! Location and price were wonderful - we took the train into the city & it was so fast and inexpensive going from Union Station to the hotel in minutes for under $5!...It is a lovely, but quirky hotel. There is only one set of elevators for each mazelike floor,lovely big windows that open up to an expanse of lower roof tops or the antics of other guests caught unaware. Plusses: Location! Cold weather not a problem with the metro under the hotel. Spacious room, nicely decorated with two full club chairs, ottoman, heavenly bed and linens. Bathroom is well thought out with nice lighting, mirrors andabundant shelving - nicely scented & presented Body Shop products. Service was top knotch. Nays: The views ( non exisitent). Lack of pool or spa - would've been so welcomed after a hard foot touring day! Internet connection charges!! Am a Marriott member and didn't know the fees could've been waived. Marriott is so below the curve on charging exhorbitant fees. Hints: Longos grocers next door - thank you previous reviewer! Made up a thrifty, healthy breakfast with Starbucks coffee, yogurt, fresh fruit and whole grain muffins for a faction of room service cost! Review #18:This hotel was fine. Billing itself as a 4* property is, in my view, misleading. Why? The rooms are fine - the difference is very poor customer service. When I went to check in, I was told there were no rooms available. After the two people in line after me were able to get rooms, my argument with the desk manager managed to secure me a key. On check out, there were a series of charges for valet parking on my bill which were reversed but only after a number of phone calls to somewhere... Most of the rooms have a view of the interior "courtyard" with a view of the garbage strewn roof of the lobby of the hotel. Note that there is no on-site parking. Valet parking is a rip-off, you can drive the 1/2 block yourself for more than half the price. If you are pressed or get a great deal, it is fine - just don't expect much. Review #19:POSITIVE: Great spacious clean rooms. The bed was really comfortable. Huge LCD tv â€“ with a connection board for laptops and other devices. Great location â€“ at the top of the Yorkville downtown area. Friendly staff. NEGATIVE Internet is not free â€“ over CAD 13 per day. No breakfast included â€“ over CAD 13. Paid parking (if you donâ€™t move the car the whole weekend itâ€™s just 15 CAD). Review #20:We stayed at the Marriott Hotel on Bloor for two nights on the 12/13th October. My first impressions were very positive - the staff were helpful, they had complied with our request for a room on a higher floor and the room when we arrived was enormous - as was the bed! It was our fist night in Toronto and we were feeling tired. We were able to walk in all directions from the hotel and find restaurants and bars, and the subway and shopping centres are literally on your doorstep. The first night was very quiet and we got a good sleep, the second night we could hear a guy in the room next door talking on his cell phone, but wehn we got back later there was again no noise and we slept well. The room and bathroom were well decorated and well appointed and extremely clean. And when we went to pick up our hire care form Avis we found out we could even access that by the elevator in the hotel - perfect! We ate out for breakfast every day at Le Pain Quotidean on Yonge just around the corner - excellent breakfast!! So no comments on quality of the hotel restaurant. As vegetarians though we found Toronto was wonderful for food!! This hotel was good value for a city hotel and ideally situated - a good introduction to Toronto! Review #21:A very nice hotel - a typical Marriott property. Although I got a deal via Hotwire, my Marriott Rewards status was honored and I received free breakfast for two, and a half bottle of local wine. The room had all the standard amenities except there was no refrigerator/mini-bar. But it's a clean and comfortable hotel and would be great in the winter as it is literally on top of the Bloor/Yonge subway station. There's a stairway/elevator directly from the lobby to the shopping mall and subway which is just a few feet away. So if you're looking for a convenient location at Toronto's busiest subway station, this hotel is for you. Review #22:I just returned from my one-week vacation in Toronto. I knew prior to my trip that I would most likely not have a room with a view. A city view was not important to me, since I would get out and see the city each day anyway. The only negative thing I have to say about this hotel is that there is no gift shop in the lobby. However there is a 24 hour grocery store right across the street from the back door of the hotel. Ok, now on to the good stuff. The room was the most comfortable, clean, and cozy room I've ever stayed in, and I've been to hundreds of luxurious hotels. The rooms look BRAND NEW because of their recent upgrades. I could have stayed in the plush bed all day just relaxing or being entertained from over 40 channels on the 27 inch TV. The bathroom was small but impressive with its new Kohler bathroom products, and like the rest of the room, it was sparkling clean. There is a nice business centre located on the 1st floor with free internet access. I did not try the restaurant because there were so many other choices right around the hotel. The location can't be beat. I will stay here every time I visit Toronto because it is located right above the Bloor-Yonge Subway Station. Just walk through the conveniently located door next to the lobby elevators and down some stairs to the subway, shopping area, and food court with over 10 restaurants. Right outside the hotel, there is more top rated shopping on Bloor Street West and Yorkville. After a full day of sightseeing, it was wonderful to come back to my quiet and peaceful room. And because most rooms face into an empty courtyard, I could look out my window and not see a person. I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Toronto. Review #23:RECOMMENDED: This centrally located business class hotel lacks an impressive lobby or public areas, but for it's a solid Marriott experience. Large well maintained and renovated rooms tastefully decorated. Workable desk area and chair. Plenty of illumination throughout.. Quiet rooms and comfortable bedding complete the experience. In room wired & wireless Internet with good access speeds. Service is friendly and efficient. This is not a dazzling property but a quality property for an executive in transit. Review #24:Our stay was brief thankfully, the tv didn't work, there was construction, so not the quietest - we allegedly stayed at an upgraded room - it was code for horrible decor really. my boyfriend forgot his watch there and their explanation was well we looked and it wasn't there. not recommended - 4 stars is an over rating for that hotel- the one good thing was the beds were comfy Review #25:This hotel is right on top of the Bloor and Yonge station. It is convenient to travel by subway in just about every direction. It is not as noisy and crowded as other neighbourhoods in downtown Toronto. We have four people staying in a room with two queen beds and it doesn't feel cramped. The hotel was renovated a couple of years ago and feels quite fresh. HD TV is a pleasure to watch. The lobby is quite small and undistinctive. The front desk is not staffed as fully as it should. One Saturday afternoon, the concierge wasn't there. We waited about 10 minutes to get a bandaid. The restaurant looks dark and unappealing. Overall, nice place. Review #26:The location is GREAT...The subway is the only way to travel..This was the first time for all of us using the subway,and it was great.The people in the subway would direct you to the proper platform to where ever we wanted to go, so simple when you ask..and cheap.The subway is right under the hotel. We went there for a concert and blue jays game.There is a market right beside the hotel with everything you can imagine and fresh. Tim Hortons around the corner or up the street. Shopping and restaurants all with in walking distance..Hemmingsway restaurant is a 10 minute walk, and has 3 outdoor rooftop patios, service and food was great and good pricing.This hotel came recommended by Lisa from the Marriott in Sudbury and everything was well above our expectations.The rooms are huge and so comfortable and clean. ALL the staff are super friendly and go above and beyond every request or questions. Zlata, Diogo and Ashley were super people and made our stay even more fun. I would highly recommend this hotel.When I go back to Toronto I will stay there again. Thanks for the fun time. Sheila from Sudbury Review #27:The hotel was older, run down and the decor is way too busy. The first room they gace me which was on the 6th floor had a windoe facing a courtyard. We checked in at night and I could not see out. I woke up naked and when i turned around all I could see were people outside my window looking in. They were on a break from a convention held at the hotel. I asked to move and they moved me to the next level up. That was all they had. This room was on the corner to a all window hallway of a convention room and I woke up again the next morning with people looking in from the window of the hallway on the corner. This hotel is poorly designed! Review #28:We won this lovely hotel through Priceline by choosing a 4 star Downtown Toronto Hotel for $75 per night. We drove up to Toronto for one night from Niagara Falls before returning home to Washington DC. This hotel was very easy to locate via Mapquest directions. The bathroom was pristine as was the bedding, however the carpet has seen better days. Also the room service from the Matisse restaurant in the Lobby was adequate and fullfilling. Big plus to this hotel is the proximity to high end shopping...Louis Vuitton, Tiffanys, Gucci, Escada, COACH, Pottery Barn and so on. Also as an added convenience PATH is located underneath the hotel. Which is the underground city of Toronto and easy access to the subway. Must do in this city is a visit to the CN Tower. If you eat at the 360 restaurant the views are breathtaking and the ride up is free. Enjoy. Review #29:We were a group of friends celebrating a birthdayin the city and booked two rooms for 8 people. both rooms were nice and looked like they had been updated recently. One of the rooms had a heating issue and a hotel employee came up to look at the heater at 330am, he was very helpful. They ended up switching the room for another room across the hall where the heat wasn't blasting. The only issue i had was trying to locate the other guests in the morning, the front desk person would not tell me where they had been moved, even though it was my name on the reservation. We asked the front desk staff to recomend a breakfast place to us, which they did, but the information was outdated and the restaurant had been closed for some time. Other than that the staff were friendly and helpful. it was nice to know they were willing to help at such an early hour. I read some poor reviews, and they must have been from before some kind of reservation work was done because the lobby and the hallways, along with the rooms were clean and very nicely decorated. Review #30:Stayed for 1 night on business using a corporate rate. Booked a regular room and was upgraded to concierge. Lobby is efficient and everyone was super friendly. Check in was fast and easy. Room was on the 6th floor overlooking another building and some type of courtyard. Room was large, comfortable and very clean -- king-sized bed, desk, armoire, and reading chair with ottoman. Really appreciated the L-shaped workspace as I could spread my materials out for the presentation I had to prepare. Housekeeping had provided the extras I have listed in my Marriott rewards profile -- good sign. Bathroom was also very clean and amenities are good quality. Concierge lounge was quiet, large, and well stocked for both hors d'oeuvres and breakfast. Had dinner with a colleague in the Matisse restaurant. Food was good, not remarkable, and the service was friendly and prompt. Had the same server at breakfast and the buffet was very good with excellent healthy options. Fortunately, we won the deal and I'll be returning to this location several times over the next few weeks. I'll plan on exploring the neighborhood more next time I'm there because there are a lot of shopping, dining and entertainment options just outside the door. Review #31:Front desk staff and management attitude not even good enough for a one star hotel. Rude and unwelcomming, and did not honour my reservation even though I gave them my credit card number when I did reservation online to guarantee my reservation. They did not even attempt to fix the problem or offer alternatives. Review #32:This hotel is clean and the room which we had upgraded to was nice but dont expect a view. The hotel only has 6 floors and a lot of the rooms face an inner courtyard. The parking is terrible as work was being done on the lower levels which the communication between the hotel and the parking authority was lack there of... Everyone booking in had either parked in valet parking or ended up having to move their cars, then walk outside around the block. the signage for parking actually stinks and the bell boys don't have a clue when asking directions to the alternative parking arrangements. We were upgraded to the nicer room only cause we had to complain for at least 10 minutes regarding the ring around the rosie ie the parking. If you dont drive... this would be good for you... but if you do, then be prepared. Dont take kids here as no pool, no view and nothing for them to do. This hotel is great for a business suited person coming in from taxi or if you can well afford to pay for valet parking but be warned even there was an issue with 2 separate occasions while we were in the lobby of people having problems with the valet parking. The attendents were new, no manager on duty on the busiest night (new years eve and yet the charge was over $200.00. The hotel like I said is nice in decor... but I have seen better. If the staff were well versed on how to problem solve and if the manager was not out galavanting around when his/her staff were trying to problem solve, then I would recomend this hotel. They dont deserve the business. Review #33:Stayed 3 nights, October 2011 Priceline bid/win of $125/night...came to $150/night with taxes Priceline calls this 4stars...I say more like 3stars Pros: Location VERY close to subway stop Bathroom fixtures/finishes very nice Bath and Body Works brand toiletries Plenty of towels Good room size Safe in room Room and bathroom very clean, tub was perfectly white. Good h20 pressure. Bed and pillows very comfy Parking in Hudson Bay garage around corner was only $11/day (did this by accident!) Cons: Generic design Hallways could use updating...wall sconces very dated; ugly carpeting No great lobby No free internet access in rooms (knew that going in...) No view from room (my room at least!) and FILTHY window made it appear dark/dreary Circular design...get off elevator and walk down hall and turn, turn again, turn again, etc. Weak hairdryer Overall: Would stay again for this price but wouldn't pay more than $125/night Review #34:I arrived at the Marriott from a long overseas flight and was nicely greeted at the front door and lobby. Best thing of all, they allowed me to choose some freebies and then sent them up to my room - a snack of wine, fruit, and pretzels in my case! My room was typical Marriott, roomy, comfortable and nicely furnished. The flatscreen TV was huge! Globe and Mail in the morning, quiet night, comfy bed, lots of pillows...and a breakfast buffet that was excellent and cheaper than some. I would happily go back again. Review #35:We enjoyed the location and decor of the Marriott Yorkville. However, our room's windows were facing the courtyard where, as the receptionis
